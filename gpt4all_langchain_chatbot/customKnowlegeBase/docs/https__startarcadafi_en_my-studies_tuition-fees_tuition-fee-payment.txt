How do I pay the tuition fee?



 










Follow these instructions when paying your annual tuition fee.

The payment is made by bank transfer. The tuition fee is paid in advance. The tuition fee must be paid as a single installment for the following academic year.
The last payment date is August 15 each academic year. After Student Affairs has confirmed the payment, you are able to register as present for the academic year and apply for extended residence permit. If you, under exceptional circumstances in cooperation with the Student Affairs office, will only be paying for the following spring semester, the deadline for the payment is 15 December, to ensure that we will be able to register you as present by 1 January. Note, that if you have not paid your tuition fee and fail to register as present in accordance with the deadlines, you will have to apply for re-enrollment and pay the fee of 50 euro.
Apply for extended residence permit before your previous permit expires. For example, if you were granted a residence permit in August 2019 you need to apply for extended residence permit on 31st of July 2020 at the latest. The application to Migri has to include an official certificate from Arcada stating that a scholarship has been granted and the fee has been paid. The certificate is provided by Student Affairs. Please e-mail E-mail: studentaffairs@arcada.fi when the payment is made.
If you meet the requirements for Arcada´s scholarship, please wait until you received the decision on your scholarship application. Academic achievement is mandatory for scholarship eligibility. If you are not eligible to apply for scholarship, you may pay the tuition fee at your convenience.
Please find the bank details below.
Arcada uses the Flywire service for tuition fee payments as of 1 Jan 2024. Updated instructions will be added to this site before end of March 2024.
Refund handling fee
Please note that all students, in case of applying for a tuition fee refund, will be charged 250€ to cover the refund administrative costs. The only exception from this rule are students whose status changes to non-fee paying.
