Placement in working life/career openings
Degrees from universities of applied sciences are vocationally oriented undergraduate degrees at bachelor level and provide a professional identity and a direct connection to the labour market. Students who have studied at Arcada have placed themselves well in working life and the degree of employment for students from Arcada after finished studies is good. After graduating you are able to work as a specialist within your field both in private and public social- and healthcare or in the third sector.
As a graduated midwife you can work with the woman throughout the span of her life as well as in the care of her healthy and ill new-born child. The midwife practices the profession within sexual care, the reproductive and gynaecological care as well as antenatal-, delivery- and pureperal care. The midwife can work within open care or at a hospital. You can work at care wards, special units and polyclinics. You can work in the private or public sector or start your own business. You can also work nationally or internationally.
Further studies
Students who have completed a bachelor’s degree at a university of applied sciences and acquired at least three years’ experience in working life can deepen their professional competence by completing a master’s degree at a university of applied sciences. The master’s degree programmes consist of 60 or 90 ECTS credits and can often be completed as part-time studies while working. The education involves a deepening of knowledge, skills and abilities aiming at developing the student’s prerequisites to engage in professional endeavours requiring independence or research, development and innovation activities within the field. A master’s degree at a university of applied sciences provides eligibility for public employment with requirement of higher academic degree.
Arcada offers five Master’s programmes within social- and healthcare: the social field, health promotion, rehabilitation and advanced clinical care (focus on patient safety) as well as global health care (in cooperation with Diak UAS). Through the Open UAS you can also carry out studies on master level without three years’ professional experience.
After completing a bachelor’s degree at a university of applied sciences, students can also apply to a master’s degree programme at a university. The admission decisions are made by the receiving higher education institution. A person who has graduated with a master's degree has access to third-cycle university programmes (licentiate and doctoral degrees) at universities. The university assesses individually for each case whether the applicant has sufficient knowledge and skills for university postgraduate education.
