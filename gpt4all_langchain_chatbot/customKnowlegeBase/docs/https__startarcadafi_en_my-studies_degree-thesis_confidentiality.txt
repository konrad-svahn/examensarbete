Confidentiality



 








The degree thesis is an official and public document. Parts of the degree thesis can be classified as confidential only in exceptional cases and for special reasons.
The confidentiality classification is possible in the following cases:

If the degree thesis contains information on inventions, new facilities, procedures or developments that can have commercial significance;
If the degree thesis contains information on documents of authorities classified as confidential as defined in the Act on the Openness of Government Activities (621/1999); or
If the degree thesis contains business secrets.

The decision is made by the Head of Department of the degree programme in question and the Administrative Director of Arcada based on the submission of the student and the supervising teacher. The application for confidentiality classification is to be addressed to the Administrative Director together with the supervising teacher’s recommendation. The student is informed of the decision with a written decision. The classified part of the degree shall be an annex to the degree thesis and is saved with the archive copy in the library archives. The classified part is never uploaded electronically. The student shall mention the parts which the confidentiality classification applies to in the agreement about commissioned degree thesis.
