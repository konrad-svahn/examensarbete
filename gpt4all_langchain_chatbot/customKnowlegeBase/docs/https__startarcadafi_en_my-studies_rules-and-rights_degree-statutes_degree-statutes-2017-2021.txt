7 § Study modules and courses
For each course the curriculum stipulates a name, the study module of which the course comprises a part, starting level for the studies, the competency aims, the learning outcome, content, the examination requirements and the course literature.

The request has to be approved by the degree programme director. For language studies, the head of the language department approves the request. When the degree programme director or the head of the language department is the examiner, the head of department makes the decision.

12 § Degree thesis and Master's thesis
At Arcada, final projects are called degree thesis for Bachelor's degrees and Master's thesis for Master's degrees.
The degree thesis is a professionally orientated, independently conducted final project, which is 15 credits in scope. The aim of the degree thesis is to deepen the student's knowledge and skills in a professional area deemed to be of central importance for the degree programme and demonstrate that he/she has developed a capacity for independent analytical thought.
The degree thesis is a scientific and vocationally-oriented thesis, which may comprise part of a larger research and development work or project, the individual student's independent contribution shall always be documented and possible to evaluate.
The Master's thesis is 30 credits in scope. It addresses specific developmental issues with relevance to working life and it is based on specific areas of interest in Arcada's research projects.
A supervisor and an assessor, who are employed by Arcada, are appointed for both the degree and the Master's thesis. In the case of a thesis written on commission for an external organisation, there can also be an expert instructor representing the commissioning party.
The degree thesis and Master's thesis shall be in the language of the degree programme, Swedish or English. Norwegian and Danish students in a Swedish degree programme may write the degree thesis in Norwegian or Danish. Degree and Master's theses in another language than English always include a short summary in English.
Students who have received permission by the head of department for the respective Swedish Bachelor's degree to deviate from the norm and write in another language than the degree language, write a longer summary of the thesis in Swedish. The language in the degree thesis is not assessed separately, but the supervisor shall guide the student to make use of the language support offered and to take personal responsibility for the language in the work.
After the degree thesis or the Master's thesis has been submitted for review, the student takes a maturity test and presents the thesis in a public forum.
An assessor together with the supervisor for the thesis performs the assessment of the degree thesis and Master's thesis. The assessor draws up the written statement that comprises a comprehensive review of the thesis and the statement is also signed by the supervisor.
The degree thesis and the Master's thesis are assessed with the grades excellent (5), good (3-4) or satisfactory (1-2). The grade is justified in the statement and established based on the thesis, maturity test and the presentation.
An approved grade for the degree thesis cannot be raised.
13 § Confidentiality for parts of the degree thesis and Master's thesis
Degree and Master's theses are official and public documents. For special reasons, the head of department of an institution, in consultation with the administrative director, can classify parts of the degree thesis as confidential, based on the presentation by the student and supervisor.
Confidentiality for parts of the degree thesis is possible in the following cases:

If the degree thesis contains information on inventions, new facilities, procedures or developments that can have commercial significance;
If the degree thesis contains information on documents of authorities classified as confidential as defined in the Act on the Openness of Government Activities (621/1999); or
If the degree thesis contains business secrets.

14 § Maturity test
Anyone taking a degree at Arcada takes a written maturity test. The maturity test shall show that the student is familiar with the subject area of the degree thesis or Master's thesis and has adequate knowledge of Finnish or Swedish. The maturity test consists of an essay prepared under supervision on a theme that is connected to the degree thesis or Master's thesis.
Based on the maturity test, the student attains formal proficiency in Swedish or Finnish for government posts on the condition that he/she takes the maturity test in the same language in which he/she received his/her education. A person is considered to have received education in the language, Finnish or Swedish, that is stated as his or her mother tongue on the leaving certificate for studies according to the Basic Education Act (628/1998) or the Upper Secondary Schools Act (629/1998) or equivalent studies, if he/she received pass marks in mother tongue studies on the leaving certificate.
Students who have received their education in another language than Finnish or Swedish, or have received their education overseas, take the maturity test in the degree language. If the maturity test is taken in a language other than Finnish or Swedish, the maturity test is reviewed solely on the basis of the content. In specific cases the rector can decide otherwise.
If the maturity test has been approved for a Bachelor's or Master's degree from a university of applied sciences or a university, the student does not need once again to demonstrate proficiency in Swedish or Finnish in the maturity test. However, a written test, whose factual content is reviewed, is required. The language in the test should also in this case meet the requirements that are set for factual prose.
15 § Language skills
A student shall within the framework of studies leading to the Bachelor's degree, or in some other way, gain

such knowledge of Finnish and Swedish that, pursuant to the Language Act (424/2003), are required by civil servants for a position in a bilingual administrative area for which a tertiary degree is a requirement and which is necessary considering the profession exercised by the student and his/her professional development,
such written and oral skills in one or two foreign languages that is necessary considering the profession exercised by the student and his/her professional development.

The provisions in clause 1 do not apply to those students who have received their education in a language other than Swedish or Finnish or those students who received their education overseas.
Students who have received their education abroad in a language other than Swedish, Norwegian or Danish and study for a degree other than a Bachelor of Health Care (Nursing in English) shall take 10 credits in Swedish and 5 credits in English. In addition, these students shall be offered at least 15 credits in Finnish within the framework for the alternatives for extension studies. Students studying for the Bachelor of Health Care degree (Nursing in English) shall take, in contrast, 5 credits in Swedish, 5 credits in Finnish and 5 credits in English.
For special reasons, a student may be exempt wholly or partly from the language skills requirements, as provided for in clauses 1 and 3. The student submits the application for exemption to the language department, which decides on the same in routine cases, or forwards it to the rector. The head of the language department is responsible for ensuring that the institution's amanuensis and Student Services are informed of the decision.
