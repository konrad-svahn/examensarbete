Structure of studies



 








The studies in sports and health promotion are tied to year-based study plans and carried out in periods where every academic year consists of four periods. Many of the courses require specific advance knowledge, which means that courses should be taken in a specific order. Upon departure from the set course programme, individual study plans are made to facilitate the course of studies.
The education builds on integrative pedagogy, which means that most courses consist of both theoretical education and practical exercises. Project work, individual studies and written assignments are included in all stages of the education.
The individual’s own responsibility for their studies and learning is emphasized and supported by individual instruction and group tuition. Within the studies good self-knowledge, a systematic use of both own and other’s experience related to a well-adapted research-based knowledge base as well as a reflecting approach are stressed.
General studies
The student learns to critically analyse their environment in order to realize the advantages of in-depth analysis. The student understands the importance of communicating purposefully and develops a fundamental understanding of the human, health and society.
Basic studies and subject studies
Knowledge in anatomy, physiology, biomechanics, sports, psychomotor and social development, control and learning are combined with proficiency in assessing and analysing health, movement and ability to function of the individual. In the basic studies the student develops a knowledge of the importance of the functional ability for the individual’s perception of health and quality of life at different stages in life. The student acquires fundamental knowledge of and skills in working in health promotion and learns to employ models and methods aiming to improve health on an individual- and group level. He/she can plan and instruct suitable exercise for different groups and support the individual to make decisions about, commence and maintain healthy changes in lifestyle.
Subject studies
The student is able to use various models and styles of instruction and education for different target groups purposefully and in a versatile manner. The student can also plan, perform and evaluate the modes of operation and the sports activities in their entirety and utilize the possibilities of sports to support the individual’s development and pedagogical development. The student can create a learning- instruction- and coaching philosophy that is based on their own fundamental values and knowledge.
The student knows the basics in anatomy and physiology and can apply the knowledge to promote health and physical activity for different target groups. The student knows the fundamentals of testing and evaluation of physical ability and assessment of health as well as plan purposeful training programmes and forms of activity based on physical tests and health assessments. The student is familiar with the individual’s physical, psychological and social development and understands the mechanisms that influence the individual’s behaviour and behavioural change in relation to promotion of sports, physical activity and habits of living. The student can communicate and utilize knowledge of different forms of communication and tools. The student can plan and lead health-promoting physical activities to advance wellbeing.

The student can co-operate in multi professional groups and with industry as well as participate in projects that support innovative thinking.
Practical training
The education consists of practical training in different work places within the field of activities of the profession in the public, private and third sector. The practice periods presuppose accepted (passed) study attainments. The practice is supervised and evaluated by supervisors and teachers.
Methodology and degree thesis
The student masters the fundamentals of information retrieval, can critically evaluate scientific publications and apply research results and research methods as a support for the care work. The student can participate in research-, development- and innovation activities and write a project- or research report.
