Accidents



 









All the students at Arcada are insured against accidents. 

The insurance covers all students during practical lessons, practical training and when travelling to and from the training place (even abroad). The insurance does not cover if students get injured in school (e.g. tripping on stairs) or under a theory lesson. The insurance does not cover travelling to and from the school. The student is required to have a private accident insurance for all other situations (not related to practical training or practical lessons).
In the event of an accident requiring urgent attention, the student should go to the nearest health centre or to YHTS, and inform the staff there that he/she is insured at the school. Be prepared that you may have to pay for the treatment services, and save all receipts for refunding purposes. You may also go to a private clinic.
Urgent illness which requires medical treatment is treated at the health centre.
