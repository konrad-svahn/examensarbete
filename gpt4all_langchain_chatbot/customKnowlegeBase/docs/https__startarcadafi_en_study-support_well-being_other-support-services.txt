Student Deacon
The Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Finland is there for you when you need someone to talk to or if you encounter sudden economical distress. Please, do not hesitate to contact me, the Student Deacon Viivi Suonto, and together we can find a way for you to move forward in your situation. Nothing is too big or too small that we could not talk about it. In unexpected economical difficulties we can also find a solution for you. Moreover, you enjoy full confidentiality, which means that anything that is said, stays between the two of us.
