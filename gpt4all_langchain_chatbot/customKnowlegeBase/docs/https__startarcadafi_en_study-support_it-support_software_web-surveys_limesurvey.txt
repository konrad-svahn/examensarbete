Limesurvey



 








There are various free survey services on the internet, but good scientific practices require good information security. Free services often cannot guarantee any information security, so therefore Arcada has acquired the Limesurvey service that we host on our own server.
All Arcada users can log on to Limesurvey at survey.arcada.fi External link using their Arcada credentials. After logging in, you can create both simple and more complex on-line questionnaires, also in parallell languages. To share the survey you can publish a link or send the link to respondents by email or by using a distribution list. After collection, you can download data in various formats such as Excel, CSV and SPSS, and Limesurvey will also provide some ready-made, simple graphs.
