A changed perspective of mental health services requires new skills
Psychiatric care has undergone some major changes during the last decades. The large psychiatric institutions have been closed down, and many people are now cared for in their homes and in different types of out-patient settings. Simultaneously the view on mental health care has been altered. Researchers as well as consumer organisations put forth the importance of patient participation as well as close co-operation with the person’s family and social network. This calls for mental health services that support the person to live a good life, despite their psychiatric disease.
The programme offers a possibility for you to develop your skills within Mental Health and Psychiatric services in a way that corresponds to the challenges described above. The programme has been developed by three Nordic universities, Mälardalen University, Arcada University of Applied Science in Helsinki, and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Gjövik. The NordMaD programme is directed to promote professionals understanding and dialogical and collaborative competences, and to increase their ability to enhance user involvement in social and mental health care.

You will study together with other students during the second cycle of MDH’s master’s degree education in caring science. However, three of the courses in MDH’s MSc programme are exchanged to the NordMaD courses. Hence, during these three courses you study together with people from the partner universities. These three courses, or modules, are organized as web-courses combined with an intensive week in each country (one every semester). During these mandatory weeks (Monday lunch – Friday lunch) students and teachers stay at the same place away from the University. Cost for travel and accommodation (shared room, but not food) for intensive courses will be financed through Nordplus.
Note: The programme is dependent of external funding, otherwise it will not start
