How to apply 



 









Applying for your degree certificate is the final thing you have to do to graduate from Arcada.

When should I apply for my degree certificate?
You can apply for your degree certificate when all studies included in the degree are passed and registered in Asta. You must be enroled and registered as present to be able to apply. The application is continuous and completed online. Processing time is three weeks after submission of a complete application. Please note that during the holiday season processing times are longer. Postage is not included in the processing period.
If you receive financial aid for students your graduation date may affect it; please familiarise yourself with Kela's regulations. External link If you apply for a degree certificate too early during a month during which you would get financial aid (before the 18th of that month), you will have to pay back that month's financial aid after you have graduated.
Please see more information about deadlines and processing times here.
