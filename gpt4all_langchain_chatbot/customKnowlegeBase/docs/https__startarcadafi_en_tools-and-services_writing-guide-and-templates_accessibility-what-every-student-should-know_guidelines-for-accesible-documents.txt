Guidelines for accesible documents



 









These guidelines are good to keep in mind regardless of if you are creating content with Microsoft Word, a web page or a PDF, or any other format. 

You are well on your way if you use Arcada's own document templates (Word) and the template for degree projects.
In order for everyone to be able to understand and read your document, it is important that you consider the guidelines we have listed here.
Keep in mind that:

save your Word documents with “.docx” (or as a template) and enter descriptive file names.
use the styles in the templates / web page with different heading levels.
use lists and create them through the menu function.
always enter alternative text for all images and visual elements e.g. a schedule or flow chart.
just use descriptive names when linking content - the reader should understand where they end up.
arrange the content logically and use a robust structure.
identify / indicate if possible the language of the document.
remember that clear language is important for accessibility. Do not forget to use the spell checker in Word.
use Word's own function "Accessibility check".
feel free to use the search function on Microsoft's support page they have excellent tips on how to improve accessibility.
