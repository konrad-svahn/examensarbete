Practical training
The education follows the EU directives of 90 ects guided practical training for public healthcare workers. The education commences with theoretical instruction which is followed by simulation exercises in the Arcada Patient Safety- and Learning Centre (APSLC) and practical training within the respective competence areas. The practical training is integrated in the education and the students participate in practical training periods from the first year of studies to the end of the studies.
The practical training always takes place outside the institution and is mostly situated in hospitals, institutions and health centres in the Helsinki area, but can also be carried out in other parts of Finland or abroad. Booking of practical training positions primarily takes place through the Jobstep employment service.
The evaluation of the practical training periods is carried out according to established models, and the forms as well as the objectives can be found at praktik.arcada.fi (not yet in live environment). The extent of the workload during the practical training period should correspond to a full week of work for a full-time employee (1 ects corresponds to 27 hours of work). Field assignments performed during the practical training are handed in at the latest two weeks after finishing the training period.
The supervising teachers and examiners can be found in the descriptions of the practical training on ASTA. Assessment forms can be found on the practical training page.

The student masters the fundamentals of information gathering, can critically evaluate scientific publications and apply research results and –methods to support the care.
