The HOAS apartments usually consist of private rooms with a common kitchen and bathroom. Most of the apartments are unfurnished, but there is a small number of furnished flats with essential furnishing (table, chair, bed, not including linen or kitchenware!). The monthly rent of a room is roughly around 300 euros, and the rent of a flat is 450-850 euros/month. There is also a security deposit which has to be paid before signing the tenancy agreement. Application forms are available on their web site and can be submitted throughout the year.
An application of apartment can be submitted immediately upon receiving a notice of acceptance. However please note that there is a great demand for the student housing, and an apartment may not be acquired on short notice. A student may have to wait in queue for several months. Therefore you should be prepared to look for for accommodation on the free market as well.
