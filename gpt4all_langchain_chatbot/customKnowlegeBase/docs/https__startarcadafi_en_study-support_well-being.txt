Well-being



 









To be able to study you also need to focus on your well-being. Balance in your everyday life is needed for you to feel physically and emotionally good.  Here we have gathered some information if you need help or support with your well-being.


Your well-being is of high priority for us at Arcada. That is why we offer you different kinds of support for our students. Maybe your study technique needs an update or you need some help finding routines that work for you. Sometimes you might need someone to talk to about your situation and well-being. You are mostly welcome to be in contact with our team.

E-mail us on E-mail: counselling@arcada.fi if you have questions or need help!
