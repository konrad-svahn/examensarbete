Blocks

The Arcada house is divided into six different blocks: A-F. Your lectures organised on campus are located in these blocks (with the exception of lectures/exercises organised in the Arcada Hall).

Room numbering - find your classroom

Arcada's room numbers are a combination of one letter and three numbers. To best navigate your way around, read the room numbering from left to right. The letter tells you which block you are going to, while the three digits are the actual room number. The first digit is always based on which floor the room is on. Inside the blocks, the doors are marked with the three digits (for example "311").

Most block doors also have a screen next to them, where you can see the list of all the rooms in that block floor.
