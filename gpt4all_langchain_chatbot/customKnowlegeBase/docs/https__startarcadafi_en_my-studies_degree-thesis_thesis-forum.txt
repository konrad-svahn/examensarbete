Presentation: Be on time to the presentation. Also others are presenting, so there is a strict timetable to be kept. The time scheduled for each presentation is max. 45 minutes for presentation of Degree Thesis, opponent's comments and discussion. Out of respect for the other students presenting at Thesis Forum no one will leave the presentation classroom before the end of the last presentation.
Prepare for thesis forum by making a visual presentation (e.g. a PowerPoint or Prezi).
