Working with social change and development as field of competence
Social change and the consequences it can have for the everyday life of the individual constitute great challenges in the welfare society. Problems regarding social inclusion, democracy and alternative arrangements of social activities are central issues in the current welfare debate. The new requirements that the late modern society creates leads to that established activities, services and operating models must change and evolve in order to be able to answer the demands and needs of the citizens. The Finnish society of today displays large challenges regarding integration. The welfare of children, youth and families, long-term unemployment, the situation of the disabled and the elderly, are areas requiring strong efforts in order to prevent and counteract marginalisation and exclusion.
