Grants for practical training abroad



 










There are three kinds of grants for practical training that are administered at Arcada:

Erasmus+ funding for practical placement longer than 2 months
Erasmus+ funding for practical placement longer than 2 months (60 days) to Erasmus+ program countries in Europe. The Erasmus+ grant is administered by International Affairs.
Erasmus+ funding for short-term blended mobility
Erasmus+ funding for short-term mobility for traineeship may be implemented as blended mobility, which includes a physical period lasting 5–30 days and a compulsory virtual component completed as remote work. For traineeships to Erasmus+ program countries (see list behind the link above).
Apply for the Erasmus+ grant well in advance before the start of your practical training. Same instructions as for longer Erasmus+ traineeships.

Erasmus grant for short-term mobility is paid for the physical mobility period only
The grant amount (1 June 2023 - 31 July 2025) is 79€/day for days 1-14 and 56€/day for days 15-30.
For students with fewer opportunities, an additional grant is paid. Different amounts compared to students going on longer mobility.

Nordplus funding
Nordplus funding for practical placement done within one of the Arcada Nordplus networks in the Nordic or Baltic countries. Administered by the International contactperson at your Degree program. You can find more information here.
Common rules both for Erasmus and Nordplus grants:

You must apply for a grant for the practical training before the training is commenced. The scholarship can’t be granted afterwards. The scholarship is paid, at the earliest, one month before the practical training begins. Submit your grant application well in advance before the start of your practical training. When applying for Erasmus practical training, apply at least 2 weeks before the start date.
You also have to read your Arcada e-mail during the practical training to secure the information flow.
You are obliged to notify the international coordinator if something changes in your internship. The abuse of scholarships leads to repayment obligations, or that the second installment of the grant will not be paid.
