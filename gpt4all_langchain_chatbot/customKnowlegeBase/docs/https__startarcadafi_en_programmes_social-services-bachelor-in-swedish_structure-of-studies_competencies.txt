Problem based learning as a resource in working life
Upon completion of studies the student is expected to be able to identify problem areas and formulate questions in different reality based situations in working life. These questions will be a foundation upon which to actively elaborate significant topics. In solving problems the students consistently reflect on the connection between theory and practice. The student has an ability for self-directive learning. The student shows responsibility in the context of professional teamwork. PBL strengthens the student´s ability to manage project work.

She or he is able to meet the client and client groups in a professional way in different social educational activities.

Moreover the student has a readiness to provide educational leadership. The student also understands changes in society and strengthens her or his readiness and boldness to influence and develop life conditions for individuals at risk.

Gerontology – ageing from an interdisciplinary perspective
Upon completion of studies the student understands ageing and the living conditions of older people in the society of today.

The student can supervise, inspire and support the elderly in coping with their lives in terms of their individual needs and resources. The student is able to collaborate and perceive the value of collaboration with relatives and professional occupational groups in the gerontology field. The student can also promote the participation and welfare of older people in society.
Placement in working life
Degrees from universities of applied sciences are vocationally oriented undergraduate degrees at bachelor level and, as opposed to a bachelor’s degree from a university, provide a professional identity and a direct connection to the labour market. Students who have studied at Arcada have placed themselves well in working life. The degree of employment for students from Arcada after finished studies is among the best in the country. After graduating you are able to work as a specialist within your field for a range of enterprises and organisations both in private and public social- and healthcare.
Further studies
Students who have completed a bachelor’s degree at a university of applied sciences and acquired at least three years’ experience in working life can deepen their professional competence by completing a master’s degree at a university of applied sciences. The master’s degree programmes consist of 60 or 90 ECTS credits and can often be completed while working. The education involves a deepening of knowledge, skills and abilities aiming at developing the student’s prerequisites to engage in professional endeavours requiring independence or research, development and innovation activities within the field. A master’s degree at a university of applied sciences provides eligibility for public employment with requirement of higher academic degree.
Arcada offers four Master’s programmes within sports, social- and healthcare: the social field, health promotion, rehabilitation and advanced clinical care (focus on patient safety) as well as global health care.
The professional competence can also be developed by attending specialisation studies that do not lead to a degree. Specialisation studies are arranged in a flexible way and are therefore suitable for persons in working life.
After completing a bachelor’s degree at a university of applied sciences, students can also apply to a master’s degree programme at a university. The admission decisions are made by the receiving higher education institution. A person who has graduated with a master's degree has access to third-cycle university programmes (licentiate and doctoral degrees) at universities. The university assesses individually for each case whether the applicant has sufficient knowledge and skills for university postgraduate education.
