FAQ: itslearning



 








Why can I login everywhere else but itslearning?
Try going to start.arcada.fi External link -> itslearning, then you should have no problems...

I.e. it is likely that you went directly to arcada.itslearning.com and tried logging in with the wrong button. If you go directly to arcada.itslearning.com, you need to choose Log in with Arcada IdP

Why does the itslearning "email" not work?
itslearning has an "inbox", but it is not the same as your Arcada email.
itslearning contains an internal messaging platform where users can message each other. Some teachers use it, some don't. As a student you need to keep up with your Arcada email and itslearning messages.
If you download the application, it is much easier to keep everything in check.
