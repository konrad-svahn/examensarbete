Your files



 









Arcada provides students and staff mainly two ways of saving their works.

1. Microsoft's OneDrive External link
2. Homedrive (H-drive in Windows)
OneDrive is a cloud service that is maintained by Microsoft and your files are stored on their servers somewhere in the world. The homedrive is maintained by Arcada and is located in our server room.
The files on OneDrive are accessible through your web browser, i.e. easily from anywhere. You can also access the files directly from the Office-programs if you are logged in with your account.
