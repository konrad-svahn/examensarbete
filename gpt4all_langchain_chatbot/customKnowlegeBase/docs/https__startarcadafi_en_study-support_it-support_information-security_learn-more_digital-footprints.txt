Digital footprints



 









When you browse Internet you always leave some kind of footprints, e.g. web pages you visited, e-mail you sent, content you search for and information you shared, but also places you visited and what computer you’ve used etc.

These are used mostly by commercial organisations to market their products. But digital footprints also result in that you’ve less control over your private data. Full anonymity can’t be guaranteed on Internet. Anyone could use these information from your footprints.
One example is images you upload on Internet. No matter where you upload them, they are easy to be shared by almost anyone. So, what will happen when you look for a job in the future? Will your digital footprints mess something up? Because of these reasons it’s good to know and be aware about your digital footprints and think twice before you share something.
