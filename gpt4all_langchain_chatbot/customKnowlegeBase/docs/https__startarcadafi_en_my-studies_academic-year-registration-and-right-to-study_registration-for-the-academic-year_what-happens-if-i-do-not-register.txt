What happens if I do not register?



 








If you have not registered for the academic year by the set date, you will lose your right to study. If you want to resume your studies, you must apply for re-enrollment. If the right to study is reinstated, you may resume your studies at the start of the following period. This means that you can lose a whole period. You should, therefore, remember to register for the academic year in time.
Processing fee
There is a 50 euro processing fee for applications for the reinstatement of the right to study,as per President's decision 20/2010, which is based on Decree 1440/2014,4 §.
If you apply for the reinstatement of the right to study, you must provide a receipt showing that 50 euro has been paid to Arcada’s bank account in Nordea FI53 1596 3000 0977 76 (Swift: NDEAFIHH), together with the application to Student Services. When making the payment, your name should be written in the message field. Student Services will only process applications that include a receipt.
