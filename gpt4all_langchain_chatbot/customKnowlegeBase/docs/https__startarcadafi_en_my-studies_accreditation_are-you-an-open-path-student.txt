Are you an Open Path Student?



 









Open Students cannot apply for accreditation, since accreditation is possible only for students who are pursuing a degree. 

You can apply for accreditation once you have been accepted as a degree student.
Please discuss your individual study plan with your study counselor in order to plan your studies in advance.
