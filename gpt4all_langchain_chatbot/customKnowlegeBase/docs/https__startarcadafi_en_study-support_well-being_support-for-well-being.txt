Support for well-being



 









Would you like to discuss your situation, studies or your well-being? Please contact the psychologist or our study social worker at Arcada.

Are you experiencing anxiety, do you feel worried or depressed? Is it affecting your studies or everyday life negatively? Please don't hesitate to contact us for a confidential discussion.
The psychologist and study social worker at Arcada provides individual counselling and guidance for students who are experiencing problems with their life in general or with their studies. You can book an appointment if you need support related to e.g.

depressed mood
worries or anxiety
life situation or studying (low-threshold worker)
social relationships

You can make an appointment when you want to discuss your situation and try to find new perspectives or tools in addressing the difficulties you are facing. The psychologist and study social worker are licensed health care professionals, and the counselling is confidential. The service is free of charge.
If your problems are more extensive, you may need more long-term support and treatment. In this case, you can contact Finnish Student Health Service (FSHS) External link or your health-care station. If you are unsure about what type of help you need, we can figure it out together.
