Further studies
Master’s degree at a university of applied sciences
Did you know that students who have completed a bachelor’s degree at a university of applied sciences and acquired at least two years’ experience in working life can deepen their professional competence by completing a master’s degree at the university of applied sciences? A master’s degree programme consists of 60 or 90 ects credits and can often be completed while working.
A master’s degree from a university of applied sciences provides eligibility for public employment with requirement of higher academic degree.
Arcada offers master’s programmes of different kinds, e.g. International Business Management.
Master’s degree at a university
After a bachelor’s degree completed at a university of applied sciences, students can apply to a master’s degree programme at a university. The second-cycle university degree usually consists of 120 credits (2 years of full-time study). The admission decisions are made by the receiving higher education institution.
Doctoral degrees
A person who has graduated with a master's degree has access to third-cycle university programmes (doctoral degrees) at universities. The university assesses individually for each case whether the applicant has sufficient knowledge and skills for university postgraduate education.
Research, development and innovation
The research areas of the institution, Digital Marketing and Big Data, have achieved a high status both within Arcada and externally. This means that you as a student can participate in various research projects and that the studies are connected to these research areas.
Collaboration
Within the context of the education we collaborate with several enterprises in the region, and as a student you can perform actual assignments for these.
