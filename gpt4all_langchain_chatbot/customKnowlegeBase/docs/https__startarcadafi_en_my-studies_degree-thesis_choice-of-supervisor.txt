Choice of supervisor



 








Every degree thesis shall have a supervisor who is employed at Arcada. The supervisor is designated in the first instance from among teachers in the student's own degree programme. At the same time an assessor of the thesis is designated.
For a degree thesis done on commission for an external party there can be an expert instructor representing the commissioning party. Read more on commissioned degree thesis.
