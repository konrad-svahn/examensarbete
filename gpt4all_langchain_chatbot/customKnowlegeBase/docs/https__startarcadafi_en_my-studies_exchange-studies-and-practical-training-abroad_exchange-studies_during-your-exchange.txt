Changes in the courses
It is not uncommon that students have to change the choice of courses for different reasons during the exchange period. If you change your course plan you need to contact your degree program director/international contact person in your programme. You need to fill in and sign a Changes to Learning Agreement form (an attachment to your Learning Agreement) which must be approved and signed by your degree programme director/international contact person in your programme. You can send the form to the responsible person by email. Try to do this within a few weeks after the studies have begun. When your updated Learning Agreement is signed by you, by your degree programme director/international contact person and by the host university, please send a scanned copy of it to international[a]arcada.fi.
It is important to contact Arcada about the changes in your Learning Agreement to make the accreditation of courses easier when you return:
Students on Erasmus exchange should fill in Erasmus+ Changes to Learning Agreement form.
Please note that Changes to Learning Agreement form is an attachment to the original Learning Agreement and these forms should always be kept together in all communication.
Please note! If you have used the OLA (Online Learning Agreement) before your exchange, you will also make possible changes in the OLA (https://learning-agreement.eu/ External link)

 
Erasmus+ Changes to Learning Agreement


Students on Nordplus, Bilateral or Freemover exchange
should use Arcada's Change to Learning Agreement form. Please note that Changes to Learning Agreement form is an attachment to the original Learning Agreement and these forms should always be kept together in all communications.

Problem situations
If you run into some problems during your stay abroad, and feel you need support, please contact the international coordinator at Arcada and the contact person in the host institution. Excluding serious illness and other drastic situations we recommend that you consult the international coordinator at Arcada before you decide to end your exchange period and return back to Finland earlier than planned. If you for some reason decide to return to Finland earlier than planned you should immediately contact the international coordinator at Arcada and the contact person in the host institution.
Please remember that your grant is tied to the length of your exchange period and in the case of an early return you will need to refund either a part of the grant or the whole grant.
Letter of Confirmation (Erasmus)
If you are on Erasmus exchange ask the international coordinator of your host university to sign a Letter of Confirmation. You can use the form from your host institution or our Letter of Confirmation form that you can find below.
