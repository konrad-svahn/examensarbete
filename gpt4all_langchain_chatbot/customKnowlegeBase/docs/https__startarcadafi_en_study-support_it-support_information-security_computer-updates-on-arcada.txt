Computer updates on Arcada



 








Arcada's computers install updates usually in the background so you do not even notice them. Sometimes the updates require a restart of the computers and you may encounter notifications.
You can choose when to make the restart. Usually it is best to do the restart after the workday because the restart might take awhile. Also remember that the login process might take a few minutes after a restart. 
Staff laptops
Please restart your laptops e.g. once every week. You can then choose when the reboot happens and you will keep your laptop updated.
