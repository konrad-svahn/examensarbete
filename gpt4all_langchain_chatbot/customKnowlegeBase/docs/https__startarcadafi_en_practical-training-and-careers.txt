Practical training and Careers



 










Here you will find information on both practical training and career support. In addition to the support you receive from your teachers, there is also a lot of other support available. Often, a guest lecture or an event outside the classroom can be the first step towards an interesting internship or even your first job. Read more about all the support you have access to as a student at Arcada!
