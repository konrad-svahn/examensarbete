OLS Language Support - language tests and language courses
Students participating in Erasmus+ student exchange must carry out an obligatory online language assessment before the exchange period. You can also assess your language skills after the mobility period but as of the academic year 2020-2021, it is no longer compulsory.
The Erasmus+ Online Language Support (OLS) language assessment is mandatory for all Erasmus students (with the exception of native speakers).
The online language assessment takes approximately 40 minutes and it assesses participants' language skills in listening, reading and writing. You will receive an email with username and password to the language test after you have been admitted to the host university.
Based on your language proficiency you have the opportunity to follow an online language course in OLS platform before and during your mobility period. You will receive more information about the OLS language assessment and courses in the pre-departure training before your mobility period.
ERASMUS+ grants
Students who go on exchange through the Erasmus+ programme will get an Erasmus+ grant via Arcada. More information about Erasmus+ grants can be found here. It is important to notice that you must apply for the grant in time before your exchange period starts.
