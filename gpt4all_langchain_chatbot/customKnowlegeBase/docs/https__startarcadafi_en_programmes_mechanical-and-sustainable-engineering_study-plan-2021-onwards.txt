The profile of the education
On the basis of the needs that exist in society and working life, the degree programme has chosen to profile itself to respond to the challenges ahead. The degree programme has the following profile that is based on society’s and working life’s needs and on Arcada’s strategy.The central themes in Arcada’s strategy that are visible in the profile are sustainable development and digitalization. The digitalization of the processes is challenging the engineering industries. Engineers are more often central decision-makers in large and small projects that aim at implementing new technologies for a sustainable future. Engineers need to be able to use modern digital tools for modeling and analyses, and understand the possibilities and limitations that digitalization brings (e.g. automation, machine learning, robotics). Evidence-based decision-making for new technologies requires that digital data and research-based knowledge is used smoothly and sustainably for smart solutions.The Mechanical and Sustainable Engineering programme combines two disciplines together to play a significant role in the pursuit of technological advancement in the field of engineering. It integrates mechanical engineering with sustainability to find new approaches in product development process that considers the current global challenges. The programme strives to finding better solutions starting from conceptual design up to process selection. As an engineering programme, the design, material selection as well as process selection will be highly driven by optimization and sustainability constraints. The programme will also be highly integrated with state-of-the-art digital design and manufacturing tools to keep our students competent in the work environment. The degree is targeted at educating engineers with diverse skillsets in design for a sustainable future. It also creates research possibilities where the quality of education will be enhanced in a continued process.
