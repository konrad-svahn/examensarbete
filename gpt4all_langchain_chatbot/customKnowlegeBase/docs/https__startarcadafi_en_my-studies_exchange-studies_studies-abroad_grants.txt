Grants



 










Everyone who goes abroad to an Arcada partner university and have their Learning Agreement approved is entitled to an Erasmus+, Arcada or Nordplus grant for their exchange. 

1 Grants via Arcada

You can get only one of the grants depending on where you are going and what kind of agreement Arcada has with the partner institution. You can check the information in the partner institution database or contact international affairs.
The grants are about 200-540 euros/month.
If you, for some reason, do not fulfill your exchange as planned according to the Learning Agreement the grant or a part of it must be reimbursed.

Students who go on exchange through the Erasmus+ program will get an Erasmus+ grant. The Erasmus grant is paid in two installments 80% before your mobility and 20% after. The first installment is paid before the start of you exchange studies.

2 Special Needs and Inclusion support - Erasmus+ and Nordplus
You can apply for exchange even if you have special needs. You should contact the international coordinator at Arcada (E-mail: international@arcada.fi) in good time before the application deadline so that we can start the arrangements as early as possible. To ensure that students with special needs can take full advantage of the Erasmus or Nordplus exchange, both programs offers extra funding for students with special needs. You may be entitled to extra funding if you have a disability, illness or other exceptional special needs that will cause extra costs during your exchange and which are not covered by other sources. You can find more information about the support for students with special needs on The Finnish National Board of Education's website External link.
