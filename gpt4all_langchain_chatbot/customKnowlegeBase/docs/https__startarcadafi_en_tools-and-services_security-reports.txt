Security reports



 









At Arcada we use an easy to use security reporting system.

The system allows you to report observations, incidents, accidents, threats or inappropriate behaviour that affect safety and the environment at Arcada. It is important that you report all incidents so that we can prevent bigger accidents from happening.
Log in here with your Arcada login details to report an incident External link. There are several categories for reports in the system. All reports are analysed confidentially and anonymously.
