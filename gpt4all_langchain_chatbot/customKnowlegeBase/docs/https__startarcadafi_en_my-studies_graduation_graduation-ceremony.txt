The graduates proceed together in the beginning of the ceremony. The entrance is lead by the Rector and faculty. All graduates are requested to be at Arcada no later than 14:30, where we will help you find your correct place in the procession.

Programme
No degree certificates are handed out during the graduation ceremony, but all graduates are given roses, a greeting letter and are personally congratulated by the Rector and a representant for your degree programme. The ceremony takes approx. one hour. After the ceremony all graduates, guests and staff join in a toast for our newest alumni. Photographing will be arranged for those who wish.
Guests
As a graduate you are welcome to invite two guests to attend the ceremony. Unfortunately the number of guests are limited due to the amount of seats. Please confirm your guests attendance when you confirm your own participation in the ceremony.
