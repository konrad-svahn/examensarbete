Teacher in charge of work placement: Linn Hongell (E-mail: linn.hongell@arcada.fi)
Work placement in general
One of the great benefits with studies in a university of applied since is the fact that part of the studies is really happening in work life. Since the education leads to a job in the chosen professional field, work life experience, the work placement, is integrated in the studies. Through the work placement the student will gain work life experience and firsthand knowledge in the chosen field/sector. Additionally, this creates network for the student that may very well lead to employment after graduation.
The placement is part of the curricula and has clear learning and competency goals that are to be met. There are two placement periods, work placement 1 and work placement 2. In total the placement is worth 30 ECTS credits, which in turn is about 20 weeks of full-time work per placement period. The work load for a student during the placement should be the same as for a full-time employee during a week. Full-time is defined separately in the branch specific agreements. A part time work placement period is calculated based on a 40-hour workload per week (400 h = 15 cr). This has to be mentioned in the work certificates of the student.
The placement is according to the study plan placed in the fourth period for second and third year students. This is more of a recommendation than a rule. The student can decide to do the work placement during other times of the year, for example during the summer or whenever it fits into the individual study plan or life situation.
Requirements
Eligible work placements should always be related to the field of study. For the more generic or basic placement (work placement 1) this is the only criteria (customer service and various office work do count).
The more professionally oriented or advanced placement period (work placement 2) requires a placement where the student can specialize according to his/hers competence area (major). This means that the work should support and relate to the student’s major (specialization) (logistics, marketing, tourism or financial management). The work tasks should on top of this the have a degree of self-directedness and own responsibility.
The work placement can also be done abroad and for this the student can apply for scholarships that are administrated by the International affairs. All documentation should in this case be handled before the work placement period starts. Please read more about it here: Practical Training Abroad and remember to register your planned practical training abroad in our mobility database before you leave here: Register planned practical training abroad.
Procedures and documentation
If you have a salary during your work placement this is considered a regular employment and in this case you should get a work certificate from the employer.The work certificate should contain:

length of the employment
a detailed work task description
the amount of completed hours has to be mentioned if it is a part time employment (job)

If you do not have a salary during your placement period you should have a work contract (see itslearning) signed by the employer, by the employee and by the teacher in charge of placements at Arcada before you start the placement. The employer is the first to sign the contract and to check the details related to the tasks etc. After this you bring it to the teacher in charge of the work placement at Arcada.
You have to register for work placement 1 or/and 2 in ASTA in order to obtain the necessary documents and the full instructions in itslearning.
The accreditation or application for study credits from the placement have to be handed in no later than one month after the placement period ended. In order to get the credits registered on the correct year the application has to be done before September 1st.
If you have a longer employment period before you started your studies at Arcada, you can possibly validate these as you work placement. Contact the teacher in charge of the placement to see if the previous work experience is eligible and can replace a work placement period.
The work placement is graded as passed/not passed.
Final Reporting
After finalised placement period see to that you have it documented in the correct way. Instructions on Itslearning.
