Deadline fall of 2023
If you wish to graduate during 2023 your application for the degree certificate needs to be submitted by December 31, 2023. Please note! We recommend that you apply for your degree certificate by December 20, 2023, since no applications will be processed during 21.12.2023 - 2.1.2024.
Around holidays processing times are longer than the usual three weeks (especially around Christmas and New Years). You will receive your degree certificate at the end of January/beginning of February if you submit your application in December. Your degree certificate will however be dated with a date in December (same date as when your application for degree certificate was complete). Read about the graduation ceremony here.
Deadline January 2024; no degree certificates in February-April 2024
Arcada will be changing its study administration system, which means we will be unable to issue degree certificates between 1.2.2024 and 1.4.2024 (preliminary timeline which can still change). If you apply for a degree certificate by 1 Feb 2024 you will receive your degree certificate during February. If you apply for a degree certificate during 2 Feb - 1 April, you will receive your physical degree certificate in April 2024 at the earliest.
Deadline spring of 2024
If you wish to graduate during the academic year of 2023-2024, you must apply for a degree certificate by 31 July 2024. If you wish to participate in the graduation ceremony in June the application for the degree certificate needs to be submitted by 31 May 2024. No degree certificates are handed out during the graduation ceremony.
If you apply during the period 1.6-31.7.2024, your application will not be processed during this time period/during the summer due to summer vacations. You can apply for the degree certificate during this time, but the degree certificate will be ready for you at the earliest at the end of August or September. The date on the certificate will be according to the date that you submitted your application.
