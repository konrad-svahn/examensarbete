Arkören - Arcada's choir



 








Arkören is Arcada’s own choir for all those who like to sing and perform.

Rehearsals every Thursday between 4.00 p.m. to 5.30 p.m.
Previous choir experience is not a necessity

The rehearsals are a great opportunity to meet other students, teachers and other staff in a pleasant music spirit.
