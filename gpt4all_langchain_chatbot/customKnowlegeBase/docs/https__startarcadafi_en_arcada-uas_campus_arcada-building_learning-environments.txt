Learning Environments



 










Arcada's unique and innovative learning environments are used in education as well as in our research, development and innovation activities.

By combining theory with practice, both on campus as well as in the working life, we want to give you the best foundation for your future career. Thatâ€™s why you during your time at Arcada get to work in our simulation areas and innovation environments.
Simulation areas
Arcada's simulation areas include, among others, Arcada's patient safety and learning center in block E4, which was named the 2010-2012 Quality Management Unit by the Ministry of Education and Culture. The simulation areas include an emergency room, a delivery room and an area built to simulate a patient room in a hospital. The areas are completely equipped with simulation dolls and modern technology used in the field. In addition, there is a machine laboratory that simulates a plastics factory in miniature, where you can follow every stage of product development and design, including the manufacturing of products.
Innovation environments
Our innovation environments include, among others, Arcada's eBusiness Lab in block F3, a modern development and learning environment where students can develop and test their business ideas in a real-world setting. Digital services and products for companies are also developed here.
Innovation is one of Arcada's fields of focus. All students, regardless of degree programme, are offered study opportunities in innovation development and entrepreneurship.
Classroom doors are open
To make your studies easier you will find that most of the classroom doors in Arcada are open. You are welcome to use the classrooms when they are not used for lectures and no booking is needed. Outside every block there is information about the current booking situation. The doors to the blocks are opened with your flex key.  Should a classroom door be locked or there is a safety issue, please contact the Info on the 2nd floor. Please note that the simulation areas, e-business lab and D4110 can not be used outside the lectures.
