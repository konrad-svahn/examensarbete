Writing guide and templates for degree thesis

A thesis writing guide (Guide for writers) on Arcada's home page provides practical advice on the use of language and the presentation of written work. The guide is pertinent to all written work at Arcada.
As a rule, a Bachelor's or Master's thesis at Arcada is written in the language of the study programme. The head of the department may grant permission for the thesis to be written in another language, but in such a case an extended abstract (10 %) must be written in the language of the study programme. During the writing process the student can seek writing guidance. The use of language in the thesis is not assessed separately, but the supervisor shall encourage the student to take advantage of the guidance available and to take responsibility for the language form of the work. Remember that the thesis is published electronically and becomes a visible business card for you!
The template for thesis is also available in LaTeX format (here External link).
