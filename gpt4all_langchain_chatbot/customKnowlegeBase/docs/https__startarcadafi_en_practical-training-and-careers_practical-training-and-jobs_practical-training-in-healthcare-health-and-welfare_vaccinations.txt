Vaccinations and vaccinations certificate for practical training



 










This information is important specially for students in the  Degree Programme in Nursing at Arcada. 
Please notice that you as a student are responsible of the documentation over the vaccionation  you have gotten.

Section 48 of the revised Infectious Diseases Act
Before the first practical training students enrolled in Social and Health care are required to check their vaccinations and get the Tuberculous risk assessment checked.
Section 48 of the revised Infectious Diseases Act governs the immunity of students participating in practical training, the aim being to protect patients. This section will apply from 1 March 2018. The purpose of the Act is to ensure that all staff members and students working at health care and social services units get vaccinated against influenza every year and are protected against measles and varicella, through either vaccination or a personal history of the disease. Those caring for children aged under 1 year must also be vaccinated against pertussis. This will improve the safety of both patients and the students.
Your practical training locations are required by law to check your suitability. It is enough that you tell your practical placement that your vaccinations are checked. A student at the degree programme in Nursing will not be permitted to begin practical training if vaccinations are not in order or hasn’t checked the risk of tuberculosis. Your practical training period may be cancelled if your suitability cannot be confirmed.
Please note, HUS demands you to bring a certificate to your practical training it is not enough to tell them.
Vaccination certificate ("Tartunta selvitys")

Check your vaccination status You can check your vaccination status using YHTS self-assessment form (linked below).
If you are not fully vaccinated or if you are not sure, please contact YHTS. If vaccination is contraindicated and you cannot be vaccinated because of an allergy, for example, the YHTS will issue a statement to this effect.
If vaccination status is by law, a verbal statement or your own notification compliant with section 48 is sufficient. A written statement about the vaccines you’ve received or diseases you’ve had is not required. (THL 2019)

Vaccinations are free of charge and can be given by YHTS. You can book an appointment at YHTS by calling to 046 710 1073.
Getting vaccinated is voluntary, and presenting a statement on suitability is also voluntary. However, your practical training location is required by law to check your suitability and the employer is not obliged to accept you for the training if your suitability cannot be confirmed.
Here is the link to YHTS page and the self-assessment form External link. 
You will need a document confirming immunity for the diseases listed below
