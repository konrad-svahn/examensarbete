Sustainability and Green Office



 









It has become more important for Arcada to think sustainably on a long term basis. As a part of our active work for sustainability we were granted the Green Office certification from WWF of Finland in 2011.

Green Office is a concrete environmental programme with the goal of reducing carbon emissions and reducing the ecological footprint of companies and offices with the aim of improving eco-efficiency. Green Office means that GO-certified organisations and their employees voluntarily commit to continuously do their best to improve the environment, reduce the ecological footprint and inspire sustainable consumer behaviour. Organisations awarded Green Office certification are audited every three years, the next time in 2026.
Arcada's environment program
We are continuously striving to decrease our electricity-, heat- and paper consumption. We are also striving to remain on the current level of water consumption. In accordance to our approved certification we agreed to actively work on achieving specific goals regarding ecological effectivity with a yearly check-up.
Focus 2023
We have encouraged our staff to bike all year round. We also joined the winter KM competition 1.1-28.2.2023 with a small Arcada team.
Arcada will participate in the Earth Hour event 25.3.2023, this year via the social media and on Campus. We wanted to encourage both students and staff to switch off lights during one hour as a part of the global movement and to take a concrete climate action and a part of our Green Office activity.
We will engaged our staff and students to answer the WWF’s Green Office consumer habit questionnaire. This is one way to reflect about how we can decrease our ecological footprint and promote a sustainable consumer behavior.
The solar panels are in full use during the snow free period of the year. This way Arcada continues to produce climate friendly energy. At the Big square screen you are able to follow how much our solar panels on the roof produce.
Again this year we will take part in the Kilometri competition with a bike team 1.5-30.9.2023. Arcada participates with a team, both for students and staff.
Arcada was audited on 28 September 2023 and we received a renewed label.
During the year we also continued to promote different events and campaigns, for example, global sustainable goals, food waste, World Water Day, sustainable consumption and sorting waste.
