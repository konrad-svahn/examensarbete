Your Windows profile



 








Your settings for each software will be saved in your Windows profile. Which means that you will have the same settings on all Arcada computers.
Please note there is no backup on your Windows profile.
Staff laptops
Staff laptops only have locally stored Windows profiles. Which means that if you e.g. logon to the auditorium computer, you will not find your files on the desktop. (But you can access your files from the H-drive or OneDrive.)
