Structure of studies (2020 or earlier)



 










The structure of studies for students admitted 2020 or earlier.
Your studies consist of 240 credits (ECTS) and the normal study time is 4 years. The studies consist of general studies (30 ECTS), basic studies (30 ECTS) and professional studies (90 ECTS). In addition, extension studies (30 ECTS), practical training (30 ECTS) and degree thesis and methodology (30 ECTS) are included in the degree. 

General studies
The general study module introduces you to your subject and to studies in general in higher education. Professional language studies in Finnish, Swedish and English are part of your general studies. (Courses are defined in your study plan)
Basic and professional studies
The basic studies focus on core and advanced mathematics. The mathematics and other science courses in the basic module are designed to support your professional study modules.
The professional studies consisting of design, material and materials processing modules are established on ranges of engineering disciplines that interconnect mechanical engineering with sustainability. You will study the key engineering approaches followed in sustainable product design and development. As part of the process in a new product development, you will study selection of sustainable materials. In addition, you will study conventional and state-of-the-art material processing technologies.
Extension studies
Your extension studies complement your general and professional studies. You degree includes 30 credits of extension studies that often consist of two modules with 15 credits each. You can choose the extension study modules based on your own interest. Arcada offers extension studies for example in advanced materials design, circular economy and Finnish language. Foreign Students who are weak in Finnish are highly recommended to take Finnish for Beginners 1, 2 and 3. This may greatly assist in finding a position in Finnish companies.
You can also choose courses from other Higher Educations Institutions as extension studies. However these and any other courses that are not listed above, should be pre-approved by your degree programme director. An interesting opportunity is to study extension studies abroad on exchange. Courses studied abroad through exchange can be accepted as part your extension studies. More information about the exchange studies can be found here. 
Work practice
The practical training (30 credits) should give knowledge and experience in relevance to working life and the programme studied. Read more about the practical training here: Practical training - Mechanical and Sustainable Engineering.
Thesis and Methodology
The module for the degree thesis includes a 15 credits thesis work and 15 credits of methodology studies. The Degree thesis is an independent research project that you undertake under the supervision of a lecturer. The courses in the thesis module will guide and instruct you how to successfully complete a thesis.
In the thesis, you need to demonstrate the following: theoretical knowledge of your subject, an ability to carry out practical research or project work, an ability to critically analyse the results and relate back to the theoretical knowledge, as well as an ability to present the results as a written academic report. The quality of your thesis has to meet the requirements of an education at a bachelorâ€™s level, in accordance to EQF level 6 (European Qualification Framework). The Criteria for Bachelor thesis assessment can be found below. The thesis topic should ideally be found in cooperation with the working life or current projects at Arcada.
The last date to hand in the thesis is often mid-April for graduating before the summer. Many supervisors and lectures are not working in June or July.
Thesis application
Your thesis process begins with you applying for a thesis title and submitting a thesis plan. Thesis topics can be selected from our laboratory webpage External link, or proposed, in case of working with companies.
For thesis works which are done for companies, a contract must be signed jointly by the company, student and supervisor. The degree thesis will be commissioned if there is a written agreement
Thesis project is usually done at the end of your study. The process of writing thesis takes from 6 months up to one year. After a successful completion of your thesis you will present your work and write a maturity exam.

Degree and Master Thesis 

The aim of studies at a university of applied sciences is to educate people in the skills of a specific professional area and develop an ability to conceptually analyse issues within that field.
