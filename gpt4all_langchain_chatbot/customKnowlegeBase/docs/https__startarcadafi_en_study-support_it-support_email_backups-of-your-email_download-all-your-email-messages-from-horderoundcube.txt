There are two ways of preserving the messages: Option A & B
Option A: Thunderbird Offline-mode
If you are already using Thunderbird for email accounts other than Arcada, use instead option B.

Press ALT + F, and the menu appears.
Choose Offline -> Work Offline.

Before Offline-mode starts, Thunderbird will download all messages locally.
Continue using Thunderbird in Offline-mode indefinitely.
Option B: Copy messages to Local Folders in Thunderbird

Create an "old-inbox" folder under Local Folders.
Copy all email from your inbox to the old-inbox folder.
Drag all Arcada email folders under Local Folders in Thunderbird.
