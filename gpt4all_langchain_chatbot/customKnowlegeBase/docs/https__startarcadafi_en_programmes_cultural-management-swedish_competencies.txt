Continued studies
Should you like to continue your studies after achieving your bachelor’s degree, there are several possibilities. You might choose to carry on at a university with master’s degree studies or, after a few years’ work experience, continue studying for a master’s degree at Arcada or another University of Applied Sciences. In the labour market a master’s degree from a UAS corresponds to a master’s degree from a university.
Arcada offers master’s degree studies in e.g. Media Management.
If you after that wish to take yet another step you might after a master’s degree continue with licentiate or doctoral studies at a university.
