Structure of studies



 









The competence-based curriculum is structured in study units, which signifies that it is recommended that the studies are carried out in a specific succession. Individual study plans are made if required to facilitate the course of studies.

General studies
The student learns to critically analyse their environment in order to comprehend the benefits of in-depth analysis. The student understands the need to communicate purposefully and develops a basic understanding of the human, health and society.
Subject of study
Basic studies – Health promotion, patient safety and evidence-based work
The student has a clear picture of their professional function and an ability to develop into a professional practitioner. The student works from a health-promoting angle with focus on patient safety. The student has a command of basic skills within clinical care and understands the structure of the human body and the basics of medical science. The student can utilize concepts within caring science and apply evidence-based knowledge in various clinical contexts.
Professional studies – Clinical competence
The student has the knowledge and preparedness to function in different care contexts, with patients of various ages, from different cultures and with diverse problems and health hindrances. The student can analyse, interpret and apply knowledge from medicine and science in the patient’s care process. The student can identify the need for development within the health- and hospital care district as well as actively seek and obtain research-based knowledge to develop the care.
Extension studies – Subject specific specialization, practical training and project work (30 ects)
For your extension studies, you can choose health or nursing related topic or courses as your extension studies, preferably after you have accomplished 120 ects according to your study plan. However, Finnish, or Swedish courses on university level are exceptions. They can be taken already after the second semester. Only 20 ects of your extension studies will be registered on your degree. The learning outcome with the extension studies is for the student to deepen their knowledge according to their own interest in a specific field in health care.
Practical training
The education follows the EU directives of 90 ects guided practical training for nurses. The education commences with theoretical instruction which is followed by simulation exercises in the Arcada Patient Safety- and Learning Center (APSLC) and practical training within the respective competence areas. The practical training is integrated in the education and the students participate in practical training periods from the first year of studies to the end of the studies.
The practical training always takes place outside the institution and is mostly situated in hospitals, institutions and health centers in the Helsinki area, but can also be carried out in other parts of Finland or abroad. The practical training reservations are done through the practice placements for future professionals in the social and health care sector: Jobiili.
The examiner of the practical training course can be found on ASTA but the supervising teacher(s) can be found on Jobiili or Itslearning. Evaluation forms and other important documents and information can be found on Itslearning in the practical training course you plan to do. 
A mid-evaluation and a final evaluation are expected to take place in every practical training period. The student is expected to book a mid and a final evaluation with the supervising teacher and the clinical supervisor. The mid-evaluation takes place on the second week of the practical training and the final evaluation takes place in the beginning of the last week of the practical training. 
The student’s personal goals for the specific practical training place should be submitted on the first week of the practical training and approved by the supervising teacher the latest on the mid-evaluation. 
During the practical training the student is working as a full-time employee (38h/week). In the table below you can see how the credits are distributed per weeks.
