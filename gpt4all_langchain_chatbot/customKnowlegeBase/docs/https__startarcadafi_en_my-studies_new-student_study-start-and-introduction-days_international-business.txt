International Business 



 









The introduction days are arranged 23 August and 26-27 August 2024, with the 23 August being aimed for our international students. The specific introduction programme will be updated and published later. Information about the beginning of your studies will also be sent per e-mail, please remember to check it regularly after your acceptance letter.


Please note that 23 August is meant for international degree students. This means that international degree students participate in all of the three days (23-27.8), while national degree students are starting their introduction days on 26-27 August (two days only).
Participation in the introduction days is mandatory. Remember to activate your Arcada IT account before the introduction days!
