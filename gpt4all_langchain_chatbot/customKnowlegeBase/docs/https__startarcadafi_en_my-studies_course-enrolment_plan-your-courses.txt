Plan Your Courses



 








Before the study module/course

Remember to sign up for the courses you want to take part in (and also withdraw your registration if you do not intend to participate!). To get a study attainment registered, you must be signed up for the course!
Check the course description in ASTA
Reflect on your own learning outcomes and competency goals for each course; think about what you already know and what you need to focus on. Make a plan for how you can achieve your goals.
Think about how to prepare yourself and plan your participation taking into account the teaching and examination forms, study activities, prerequisites and so on.
Check the reading list; sometimes it may be worth reserving the books on time. Also check related literature that may be useful in the context of the course.

During the study module/course

Check itslearning, your Arcada email and ARBS regularly to stay updated on what is going on in the course and possible changes in course content or schedules.
Take an active role together with your fellow students, learn and study together, create study groups etc. to make your studies both more fun and more efficient.
Give constructive feedback to the teacher already during the courses, this gives you a real opportunity to influence the course.

After the study module/course

Think about what you have learned during the course, how you can use it in practice and how you can associate it with things you have learned earlier in your studies.
Think about what you have learned about the way you learn and how you can develop your own learning.
Think about your plan; was it clear enough, structured into clear milestones and realistic enough? Is there something you need to consider prior to the next course or study module?
Your grades will show up in your study registry (ASTA) within 3 weeks of the examination. Should this not be the case, you can primarily contact your course teacher, then your programme director or ASK.
Do not miss the chance to provide feedback on the course.
