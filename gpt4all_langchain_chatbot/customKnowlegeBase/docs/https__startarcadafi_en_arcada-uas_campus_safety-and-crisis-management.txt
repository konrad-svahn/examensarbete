Safety and crisis management 



 










It is everyone's responsibility to work together to establish a safe and secure study environment. In crisis situations, we all need to know how to act. Get acquainted with the following instructions on how to act in a crisis.

It is your obligation to address dangerous situations if you become aware of such and to act in a crisis.
Immediate action in a crisis
In an acute crisis situation at Arcada:

Always call the general emergency number 112
Tell them who you are and what has happened.
Give the address (Arcada, Jan-Magnus Janssonin aukio 1), floor and any other specific information
Don’t hang up until you are given permission to do so
Inform the information desk of the situation
Meet the emergency personnel

Security reports
Arcada's safety reporting tool External link allows you to report observations, incidents, accidents, threats or inappropriate behaviour that affect safety and the environment at Arcada. It is important that you report all event so that we can prevent bigger accidents and investigate incidents.
The tool has several different categories for reports. It is possible to attach images to the reports.
The reports are primarily handled by our Head of Security, but the different categories have different responsible persons. All reports are treated confidentially and anonymously.
Remember that there is no such thing as an unnecessary report - however, there can be serious consequences if you do not report things you have reacted to.
Crisis management team
Arcada's rector leads the crisis management team, which continuously works with safety at Arcada. At Arcada there are also appointed block managers, who are responsible for the safety of the six blocks. In case of a crisis situation, such as fire, accidents, medical emergencies or threatening persons and situations, you must follow the instructions of the block manager. In a crisis, the block manager wears a yellow vest. The Head of Security wears an orange vest.
