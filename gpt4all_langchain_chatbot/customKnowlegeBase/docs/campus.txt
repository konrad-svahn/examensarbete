Arcada building

We moved into our beautiful and modern Arcada building during the autumn of 2004. It was built for us and our specific needs, as a part of our campus. The building is owned by Fastighets Ab Arcada Nova. On the central indoor squares there is a student cafeteria and open spaces where everyone can meet up.
