Transferring courses from Novia to Arcada



 









Transfer of compulsory courses from Novia to Arcada

If your study plan includes courses at Novia UAS you don't have to apply separately for accreditation. It's sufficient to fill out Form 6b (below) to transfer your courses from Novia to Arcada. The easiest way to document your Novia courses is to log in to the My Studyinfo External link-site to create a shared link for your Novia study attainments. You can then put the link in the form. For instructions on how to use My Studyinfo see below.
Note, if you have taken courses at Novia that are not part of your study plan, you will have to fill out the form for accreditation (Form 6) to get these transferred to Arcada.
