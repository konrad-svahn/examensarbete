Structure of studies



 









.

The curriculum for the education in cultural management is carried out in study units consisting of 10-30 study credits, which emanate from vocation-related work processes e.g. event production, project management and audience activities. This gives you as a student the possibility to produce e.g. events, festivals and theatre productions. Subject-based courses are implemented in study units where they best support the working process.
Every study unit is organised in the form of a learning project where the primary examination is a product that is evaluated, e.g. a festival, a blog for an event, a club or culture service. These learning projects are documented in a competence portfolio that develops your learning competence and ability to self-guiding and self-assessment. The basis of the studies is social constructivist pedagogy. The role of the teacher is to guide the student in investigative and developing work.
Every year of study is focused on a certain theme: The first year is concerned with events and experiences and constitutes an introduction to creating art- and media experiences, communication and production of events and festivals. During the year you carry out a larger cross-disciplinary project that comprises e.g. festival- and online experiences. All first year students work together in developing communication solutions for the project as well as other parts of its production.
The second year educates you in the handling of different production processes and is named Creative Production Processes. The year combines different innovation processes, such as project management, with creative practical training to generate a creative approach to the production of culture. The year of study also encompasses the necessary skills for artistic creation. Additionally, you are introduced to leadership, cultural politics and the working profile of the artist manager.
The third year integrates entrepreneurship with different artistic experiences and application of art. You learn to work across sectors and participate in a longer practical training within a field of your choice, either in Finland or abroad. The theme of the year is Entrepreneurship and promotion of participation.
During the fourth year you have the opportunity to still further develop and widen your competence in the direction you wish. A number of collaborations with other programmes at Arcada, key persons and organisations in the creative field and the culture sector guarantee you this possibility. You can choose to specialise in business administration, international culture management, socioculture, production of cultural events or media culture. Through your degree thesis you can further develop your historical and theoretical understanding of the culture field and the development of cultural economy. This way you develop the ability to create your own creative initiatives, which can be praxis-based, research-based, policy-based or a combination of these.
General studies
You are able to use information- and communication technology and other tools used in your studies in order to facilitate target-oriented and self-directed studies. You develop your language competence in Swedish, Finnish and English.
Basic-and subject studies
Extension studies
The extension studies enable you to familiarise yourself with other sectors and/or immerse yourself in more cultural projects and productions.
Practical training
You perform a shorter practical training period during the first year within the framework of the study unit event production.
The second year is commenced with project management which is not practical training, but learning while working. You work with a project for different organisations and participate in classroom teaching where you deal with different themes within project management.
During the third year you take part in an extended practical training comprising 30 ects.
Should you take part in unpaid practical training you should PRIOR to commencing the practical training draw up a contract between you, Arcada and the employer. Fill out an Arcada practical training contract form (the form is also available in Finnish and English). If you receive a salary for your practical training, your work contract regulates your right.
Methodology and degree thesis
The aim of studies at a university of applied sciences is to educate people that should have a competence within a specific area and an ability for the conceptual assessment of relevant concerns in the field. The degree thesis is a vocation-oriented independent final composition.
The degree thesis should indicate that you have gained certain knowledge and gained certain skills as well as developed an ability for independent reflection. This requires that you as the writer independently should be able to solve that or those problem(s) that make up the foundation of the degree thesis based on the knowledge and skills you have gained in your education.
The qualitative level of the degree thesis should correspond to the requirements of a Bachelor thesis, i.e. according to EQF level 6 (European Qualification Network External link). The work should display balanced judgement, subject knowledge and ability to come to insight.
At Arcada there are degree theses of many different natures. The degree thesis is structured so that it supports your competence and preferences and thus consequently leads to new, more innovative approaches and social innovations. Read more about the degree thesis in the section course of studies.
