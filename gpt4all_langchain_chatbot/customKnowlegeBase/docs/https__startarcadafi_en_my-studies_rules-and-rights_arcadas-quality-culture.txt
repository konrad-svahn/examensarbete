Arcada's quality culture



 









Quality entails that Arcada reaches the goals the management has set for the operations. Specifically, this means that students at Arcada complete their degrees within given time constraints or more rapidly, and are well placed in working life (well employed), and that the research leads to added societal value and sustainable development.

The Arcada quality culture is based on result awareness, individual taking of responsibility and an open climate/dialogue and interaction with the environment.
Everybody – both students as well as staff – contributes to Arcada' reaching the goals.
How can you as a student contribute to Arcada’s quality?
The individual student contributes to a good university environment by conducting active studies, with ambitious and relevant goals and by giving the university response on the education and instruction through various response mechanisms and on working life and the relevance of contacts with working life through, e.g. practical training period reports.
The direct communication between heads, lecturers, instructors, tutors, researchers, students and administrative staff constitute an important ingredient in the Arcada quality structure. The personal contact areas are of the greatest relevance when collecting information on the contents of the studies and study environment. So if you experience problems or that something is lacking, please contact the responsible personnel and share your opinions! You can also give feedback in other ways, e.g. through focus-group interviews and course evaluations.
Did you know that Arcada’s management and the Arcada Student Union – ASK meet regularly? The Rector and the board of ASK meet to discuss current events, but also to discuss potential problems. The aim of this active dialogue between students and management is to quickly take on potential challenges or to develop and improve Arcada’s operations.
The students can affect the quality of Arcada’s operations through engagement in the central decision-making organs, working- and expert groups of Arcada. The students are represented in the Board of the University, quality councils and different committees and working groups.
