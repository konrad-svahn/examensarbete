FAQ: IT Account and Password



 








I changed my password and now the WLAN does not work on my mobile devices, what should I do?
Please note that when you change your Arcada password, you will need to type the new password into all you mobile devices that are connected to the Eduroam WLAN. This may require letting the device "forget" eduroam, restarting the device and then providing the new credentials.
