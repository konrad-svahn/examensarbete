Competencies



 








On graduation you receive the title of: Bachelor of Engineering.
The degree programme trains you to become an expert in fields ranging from e.g. mould/product design, material selection and machine operation to testing and analysis. The professional competences include:
Mould/Product/Part Design
As a student you gain knowledge of the moulds used to manufacture components by injection moulding. You can design products using modern softwares and are familiar with modern methods of additive manufacturing (such as 3 D printing). After examination you have expertise to participate in an engineering team for the production of designs, prototypes, moulds and products.
Material Selection
You gain advanced knowledge on polymers. You can relate the chemical structure and properties of polymers to its performance as a processing material or final product. You also have the capacity to be responsible for the material selection in design projects and for other engineering applications.
Material Processing
As a student at the programme you have gain knowledge on methods, tools and machinery used in materials processing. You can operate an extruder, use injection moulding machine and prepare composite laminates. You also have gained expertise to work as an operator or supervisor in manufacturing.
Material and Product Development
You acquire knowledge on standard testing and analysis procedures for polymer based materials. You can test the properties of materials such as strength and viscosity. Upon graduation you have the abilities to participate in material research and development projects.
In addition the student will:

Be able to obtain, understand and evaluate complex technical information
Be able to foresee changes and to be able to adjust to new situations and to benefit from new possibilities
Be able to develop and create solutions to problems
Know and accept different cultures and to be able to work with people from different background

Career opportunities
As a graduate you qualify for a position as an engineer or supervisor at an industrial company. Material and engineering specialists are needed in practically every business field, from manufacturing industry to their supply chains, as well as in the public sector. 
Some typical job titles include Process Engineer, Product Engineer, Design Engineer, Laboratory Engineer, Materials Engineer or Sales Engineer. 
Postgraduate studies 
A master’s degree at a university of applied sciences
Students who have completed a bachelor’s degree at a university of applied sciences and acquired at least three years’ experience in working life can deepen their professional competence by completing a master’s degree at the university of applied sciences. The master’s degree programmes consist of 60 or 90 credits and can often be completed while working. Starting from 2016 Arcada will offer a Master’s degree programme in Real Estate Energy for Bachelors of Engineering.
A master’s degree at a university
After a bachelor’s degree completed at a university of applied sciences, students can apply to a master’s degree programme at a university. The second-cycle university degree usually consists of 120 credits (2 years of full-time study). The admission decisions are made by the receiving higher education institution.
Licentiate and doctoral degrees
A person who has graduated with a master's degree has access to third-cycle university programmes (licentiate and doctoral degrees) at universities. The university assesses individually for each case whether the applicant has sufficient knowledge and skills for university postgraduate education.
Specialisation studies
The professional competence can also be developed by attending specialization studies that do not lead to a degree. Specialisation studies are arranged in a flexible way and are therefore suitable for persons in working life.
