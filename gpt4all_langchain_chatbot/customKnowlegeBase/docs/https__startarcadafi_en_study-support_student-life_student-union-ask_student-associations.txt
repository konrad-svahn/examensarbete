Arcada Entrepreneurship Society (AES)
Arcada Entrepreneurship Society (AES) was founded in 2013 to bring this community to Arcada.
Our goal is to build an ecosystem around entrepreneurship at the school and inspire all students to cooperation and entrepreneurship. We want to encourage the students to believe in their dreams and to not be afraid of failure. We want to change the attitude towards entrepreneurship into something that's easily accessible and that everyone could try.
Our events make no demands on the participants; all students are welcome, no matter their subject. As all our events are in English, no one is left behind.
You can find more information about us here  External link, and follow us on Instagram External link, LinkedIn External link and Facebook External link.
