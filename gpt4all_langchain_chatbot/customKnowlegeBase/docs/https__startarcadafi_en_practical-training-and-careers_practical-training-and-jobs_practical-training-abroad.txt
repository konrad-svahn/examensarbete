Practical Training Abroad



 









To do your practical training abroad gives you an excellent opportunity to practice your language skills and you get an insight into working life in another country. 

There are different ways of searching for practical training placements abroad: you can search for placements in already established networks, you can search for one independently, and you can check with the International contact person at your Degree programme if one of our partner universities is able to assist you to find a place.

Practical training abroad is supervised and administered in the same way as practical training done in Finland by the Degree programmes. N.B Specific information regarding practical training abroad for Nursing students: Practical training abroad for health care students
Please find information regarding scholarships for practical training under the headline 'Grants for practical training' in the menue at the top of the page to the left.
Read the information on page 'Good to remember prior to practical training abroad' well in advance before the start of your practical training (also in the menue)
Remember to register your planned practical training abroad in our mobility database before you leave.
