Not sure what your strengths are? Have you chosen the 'right' study path? Where can you find a workplace or internship? Arcada's career support helps you as an Arcada student or recent graduate with your career planning and your next step. Our career counsellors are here for you who have questions and concerns regarding studies, jobs or future plans.


Are you unsure about your career choices?
We support you in your choice of current and future education based on your situation. You can discuss with us, e.g. different study opportunities and the next step in your studies. We support you in getting clarity on your career options, identify your skills and put them into words, and make a career plan. Our guidance counsellors support you with practical job search and help you improve your CV and application and prepare you for job interviews.
Please note that Karriärcenter Arabia has no agreements with companies regarding internships or jobs. Students are responsible for finding their internship positions.
Ask us about studies or jobs!
Arcada's career counsellors offer drop-in hours on Tuesdays from 12 to 15 at Career Center (Karriärcenter Arabia). You will find us by the main entrance opposite the elevators.
Outside of drop-in hours, you can book an individual appointment via Career Centre's booking calendar.  External linkWe offer counselling both on campus and online in Swedish, English and Russian. Follow @karriarcentret External link to receive invitations to our events.
