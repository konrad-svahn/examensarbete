Types of Degree Thesis achieved at Arcada



 








The Degree Thesis is a test of knowledge that can be designed and evaluated in many different ways. Arcada features many varieties of degree thesis and the different education programmes have formed the thesis so that it well fits the education process. Today there are also requirements that the thesis should be designed better so that it would support the student´s own competence and preference and so lead to new, more innovative approaches and social innovations.
Business – or marketing plan
for companies. The Degree Thesis consists of the actual plan made for the management and a report where the student presents the choice of structure for the plan and the considerations he/she made during the process. The plan and the report are evaluated as a whole. The thesis can also be written on the basis of the student´s own business idea.
Artistic work
such as a film or equivalent, where the thesis consists of a production and a report that describes the professional considerations and choices the student has made during the creative process. The production and the report are evaluated as a whole.
Practical work
such as a sports event, staging an international trade fair department, carry out a PR-or marketing campaign, in which case the thesis can be documentation of the event such as a film or a report that describes the professional considerations and choices the student has made. The event and the report are evaluated as a whole.
Product development
such as a machine, software, instrument, quality system or a welfare report carried out for a company or organization. The thesis then consists of the product and a report where the student shows his/her capability to practise his/her knowledge and skills. The product and report are evaluated as a whole.
Service development
involves development of a new process or a concept where the interaction between the service provider (a company or organization) and the consumer/client/patient improves. The process and/or concept are developed through the student´s capacity and skill to describe and structure the activities so that the interaction between the service provider and the client improves and creates value. The developed process or concept is evaluated in the form of a report.
Investigation work
with an explorative approach which can involve a certain imbalance between the different parts of the work. The methodology part is often relatively short and defines only the measuring instruments used for the empirical survey. The empirical part should give a comprehensive and rich description of the phenomenon that is being surveyed. The grade is essentially determined on how meaningful and comprehensive the survey is.
Scientific works
where there necessarily isn´t an explicit requirement of scientific contribution from the thesis. The thesis can be a report of a literature study, a qualitative study based on for example interviews or an evaluation of an intervention. Scientific works can be connected to the university’s research-, development- and innovation work and the profile fields and contributes to develop the professional field.
