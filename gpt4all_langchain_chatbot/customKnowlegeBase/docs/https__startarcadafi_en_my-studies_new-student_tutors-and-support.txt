Tutors and Support



 










To get started with the studies, you can turn to both the study counselor or the degree programme director at your department.

It is also worthwhile to familiarise yourself with the study plan for your programme. Everything is available here at Start under My studies and the respective departments.
If you need help, you can always contact the study counselor at your programme. In addition, there is a whole team of tutors who are ready to answer your questions.
Student tutors
The tutors are a group of students who help you as a new student to get started with your studies, find your way in canpus and with various types of questions related to studies and student life. The tutors organize different types of events at the beginning of the academic year, so that all new students get to know each other. You will meet your student tutors on the introduction days in August.
