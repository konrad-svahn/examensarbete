Lending of equipment



 








Lending for students
IT-support does not lend hardware to students directly. If a student needs e.g. a sound recorder for their thesis, the student can ask their supervisor to lend the equipment from the IT-support. The teacher is responsible for returning the equipment.
Lending for teachers and staff
Teachers can lend all kinds of hardware from the self-service shelf in C1.
