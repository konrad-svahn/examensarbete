6 § Curricula

The Board determines the curriculum for each degree every fourth year at a minimum.
The curriculum is based on the structure of the studies pursuant to §5. The curriculum contains a description of society’s needs that are met, a description of the degree profile and a description of the competencies comprising general and profession-specific competencies, and names and descriptions of the modules.
7§ Implementation of the curriculum
The curriculum is implemented within the framework of the modules defined in the degree requirements as study units which are registered according to achievement.
The head of the department determines the realisation of the curriculum annually after it has been approved by the Management Team.
The examiner is responsible for the planning, realisation and development of the study unit. The examiner is also responsible for the description of the study unit according to the structure and the time frame given by the university. The study unit can be completed through courses, projects, practical work, laboratory work or other forms of teaching that attain the results required for completion of the study unit.
Should the student need an individual adaptation of the curriculum, the student should apply for and draw up an individual study plan as determined and informed by Arcada. A student, who has been absent, shall draw up an individual study plan prior to resuming his/her studies.
8 § Registration for and participation in study units

In order to have the right to participate in an individual study unit, the student is required to register and to be accepted. Registrations are submitted via Arcada’s study administrative system at the time and date stated in the system. The examiner confirms whether the registered student has the right to participate.
In exceptional cases, study units may have a limited number of participants. Should the number of participants be limited, this shall be stated in the ratified description of the study unit.
When the participation in a study unit is limited, priority is given to students for whom the unit comprises a mandatory part of their studies.
If the number of advance registrations is insufficient, the study unit may be cancelled by the head of department.

9 § Examinations

The examination requirements for a study unit shall be clearly stated in the unit description. The examination requirements shall be compatible with the learning outcomes for the study unit.
An approved study attainment is assessed with the grades excellent (5), very good (4), good (3), satisfactory (2) or sufficient (1). On special grounds a study attainment can be assessed with completed or pass/fail.
The results of an assessed study attainment shall be communicated to the student within four (4) weeks of the examination date. The assessed study attainments shall be saved in the original for twelve (12) months from the date the results were communicated to the student.
Partly completed study attainments become invalid once the study unit is no longer offered, unless otherwise notified.
A failed study unit, which has been assessed by written examination, can be retaken within one year from the end of the study unit. Within this period, two re-examinations are arranged. For other forms of examination, failed study attainments are revised and supplemented as determined by the examiner.
Within a year from the completion of a study unit, a student has the right to once attempt to improve the grade for a completed study attainment assessed by written examination. During this period two re-examinations are arranged. An attempt to improve the grade cannot lower the grade. A student cannot retake a successfully completed and passed study unit.

10 § Credit transfer for completed courses and validation of competencies

Within the framework for the degree programmes at Arcada, a student can request an accreditation of studies completed at another university or at another educational institution at the same level, or with equivalent practical training or work experience. Also such competence that has been acquired previously or is acquired during the time of study informally from working or organisational life can by validation be included in the degree.
The initiative for accreditation of completed studies or validation of competence is taken by the student, who is also responsible for presenting sufficient documentation for the assessment of the completed studies or competence. The request is approved by the Degree Programme Director or Principal Lecturer. For language studies, the head of the language department approves the request.
A decision on the request for accreditation of studies or validation of competence shall be communicated to the student within three (3) weeks from the date when the complete request was submitted.
In order for a student to be able to include studies that he/she intends to take in another way than via studies provided by Arcada, an individual study plan should be drawn up in advance.

11 § Theses

The Bachelor’s thesis for UAS degrees is a professionally orientated, independently conducted final project, which is 15 credits in scope. The aim of the degree thesis is to deepen the student's knowledge and skills in a professional area considered to be of central importance for the degree programme and to demonstrate that the student has developed a capacity for independent analytical thought. The degree thesis is a scientific and profession-oriented thesis, which may comprise part of a larger research and development work or project.
The Master's thesis is 30 credits in scope. The aim of the degree thesis is to deepen the student's knowledge and skills in a professional area deemed to be of central importance for the degree programme and to demonstrate that the student has developed a capacity for independent analytical thought. The thesis is a scientific and profession-oriented study and can be based on specific areas of interest in Arcada's research projects.
The degree thesis may be completed individually or as a group. The individual student's independent contribution shall always be documented and possible to evaluate.
A supervisor and an assessor, who are employed by Arcada, are appointed.. In the case of a thesis written on commission for an external organisation, there can also be an expert instructor representing the commissioning party.
The degree thesis shall as a rule be in the language of the degree programme, Swedish or English. Norwegian and Danish students in a Swedish degree programme may write the degree thesis in Norwegian or Danish. Degree theses and Master's theses in another language than English always include an Abstract in English.
Students who have received permission by the head of department for the respective Swedish degree thesis to deviate from the norm and write in another language than that of the degree programme, must write a longer summary of the thesis in Swedish. The language in the degree thesis is not assessed separately, but the supervisor shall guide the student to make use of the language support offered and to take personal responsibility for the language in the work.
An assessor together with the supervisor for the thesis performs the assessment of the degree thesis. The assessor draws up the written statement that comprises a comprehensive review of the thesis and which is also signed by the supervisor.
Degree theses are assessed with the grades excellent (5), very good (4), good (3), satisfactory (2) or sufficient (1).
The grade given for an approved degree thesis cannot be improved.
12 § Confidentiality for parts of the thesis

Theses are official and public documents. For special reasons, the head of department of an institution, in consultation with the administrative director, can classify parts of the degree thesis as confidential, based on the presentation by the student and supervisor.
Confidentiality for parts of the degree thesis is possible in the following cases:

If the thesis contains information on inventions, new facilities, procedures or developments that can have commercial significance;
If the thesis contains information on documents of authorities classified as confidential as defined in the Act on the Openness of Government Activities (621/1999); or
If the thesis contains business secrets.


13 § Maturity test

Anyone taking a degree at Arcada takes a written maturity test. The maturity test shall show that the student is familiar with the subject area of the thesis and has adequate knowledge of Finnish or Swedish. The maturity test consists of an essay prepared under supervision on a theme that is connected to the thesis.
Based on the maturity test, the student attains excellent proficiency in Swedish or Finnish for government posts on the condition that he/she takes the maturity test in the same language in which he/she received his/her education. A person is considered to have received education in the language, Finnish or Swedish, that is stated as his or her mother tongue on the leaving certificate for studies according to the Basic Education Act (628/1998) or the Upper Secondary Schools Act (629/1998) or equivalent studies, if he/she received pass marks in mother tongue studies on the leaving certificate.
Students who have received their education in another language than Finnish or Swedish, or have received their education overseas, take the maturity test in the degree language. If the maturity test is taken in a language other than Finnish or Swedish, the maturity test is reviewed solely on the basis of the content. In specific cases the rector can decide otherwise.
If a previous maturity test for a Bachelor's or Master's degree from a university of applied sciences or a university has been approved, the student does not need to demonstrate proficiency in Swedish or Finnish once again. In these cases, the maturity test can be taken in an alternative way, as determined by the Degree Programme Director or the Principal Lecturer.

14 § Language skills

A student shall within the framework of studies leading to the Bachelor's degree, or in some other way, gain

such knowledge of Finnish and Swedish that, pursuant to the Language Act (424/2003), is required by civil servants for a position in a bilingual administrative area for which a tertiary degree is a requirement and which is necessary considering the profession exercised by the student and his/her professional development,
such written and oral skills in one or two foreign languages that are necessary considering the profession exercised by the student and his/her professional development.

The provisions in clause 1 do not apply to those students who have received their education in a language other than Swedish or Finnish or those students who received their education overseas. Arcada determines the language requirements demanded of these students.
For special reasons, a student may be exempt wholly or partly from the language skills requirements, as provided for in clauses 1 and 2. The student submits the application for exemption to the head of the language department, which decides on the issue in routine cases, or forwards it to the rector. The head of the language department is responsible for ensuring that the concerned institution's amanuensis and Student Services are informed of the decision.

15 § Degree certificates

When all study attainments required for the Bachelor's degree or Master's degree have been registered, a request for a degree certificate can be submitted as determined and informed by Arcada. An appendix intended for international use is attached to the degree certificate, giving information on Arcada, the studies, and the academic attainments referred to on the degree certificate, as well as their level and their position in the educational system.

16 § Double Degree

Double Degree refers to a degree where a student of Arcada’s at one or more foreign partner universities, or a foreign partner university’s student at Arcada takes at least 60 credits for the Bachelor's degree and at least 30 credits for the Master's degree. The criteria for the degree, such as the scope of the studies, level and content are agreed on separately with the partner university.
Arcada only awards certificates for double degrees to students who obtain a degree certificate from the partner university. On the degree certificate, it is specified that the student studied within the framework of a double degree.
Students at Arcada apply to the double degree programme through the student exchange selection.

The right to study for Bachelor's as well as Master's degrees is granted by the rector. A student who has been admitted to Arcada obtains the right to study by confirming that the study place has been accepted. To maintain the right to study, the student shall register for the academic year annually. A student may, after accepting the offered study place, register as absent if he/she during the first academic year fulfils national service under the Conscription Act, Non-Military Service Act or Act on Women's Voluntary Military Service; is on maternity, paternity or parental leave; or is incapable of commencing his/her studies due to personal illness or injury.
The studies shall be completed within a time that is no more than one year longer than postulated by the scope of the degree. After this, the right to study ceases. In the study time is not included absence due to service under the Conscription Act, Non-Military Service Act or Act on Women's Voluntary Military Service; maternity, paternity or parental leave; nor any other absence for no more than two terms for which the student has registered as being absent.

19 § Tuition fee

A student who is required to pay a tuition fee for studies leading to a degree, according to the Finnish Universities of Applied Sciences Act 13 a §, pays the tuition fee when accepting his/her study place and thereafter receives the right to study. The student cannot register as present during the annual registration period before he/she has paid the tuition fee. No tuition fee is collected for the time for which the student has registered as being absent.

20 § Registration for the academic year

The right to pursue studies requires a valid registration of attendance at Arcada.
Each student shall annually, within the time limit set and informed by Arcada, register as attending or absent from commencing the academic year.
A student may, without giving a reason, change the registration of attendance to notice of absence during the academic year for the periods 3 and 4 by submitting a notification of change to Student Services, within the time limit set and informed by Arcada.
A student, with the support of a medical certificate, can change a registration of attendance retroactively to absence by separate request.

21 § Loss of the right to study

A student who has not registered in the way set out in 18 § cl. 1, or who has not completed his or studies within the time stated in 18 § cl. 2, or who has not paid the tuition fee as stipulated in 19 §, loses the right to study.
A student who loses the right to study because he or she has not registered, may during the same academic year apply for re-enrolment as determined and informed by Arcada.

22 § Extended right to study

A student who has not completed his or her studies within the time stated in 18 § cl. 2, may apply for extra time to complete the studies. The application shall be made before the right to study expires. A target-oriented and viable plan is a prerequisite for granting an extended right to study. In the plan, the student shall specify the studies that will be completed and provide a timetable for his or her graduation.
A processing fee will be charged pursuant to the government decree on fees charged for the activities of universities of applied sciences (1440/2014).

23 § Renewed right to study

A student who has lost their right to study because it has expired according to 18 § cl. 2, or who has terminated their studies themselves and want to begin or resume them later, may apply for renewed right to study. Renewed right to study can be granted more than once only in exceptional cases.
A processing fee will be charged pursuant to the government decree on fees charged for the activities of universities of applied sciences (1440/2014).

24 § Revoking the right to study

Arcada can revoke the right to study for students studying for degrees in the fields of social services and health care or sports, if

the student has repeatedly or seriously endangered the health or safety of another person during the studies, thereby demonstrating his/her ineptitude for practical tasks or training linked to the studies,
it is obvious that the student's state of health or functional ability does not meet the requirements for admission according to the Finnish Universities of Applied Sciences Act 26 § cl. 1, or
the student, when applying for admission, has withheld a previous decision on revocation of the right to study as set out in the Finnish Universities of Applied Sciences Act 26 § cl. 2, and which could have constituted an obstacle for admission as a student.

When the studies or study-related practical training require work with minors to a considerable extent, Arcada can revoke the right to study if it is necessary to protect minors and if the student has been sentenced for a crime as specified in chapter 17, 18, 18 a or 19 §; chapter 20; chapter 21 1–3 or 6 §, chapter 31 2 § or chapter 50 1, 2, 3, 4 or 4 a § of the Penal Code (39/1889).
Before the right to study is revoked, Arcada shall examine the possibilities for applying to another degree programme in consultation with the student. The student can, with his/her consent, be transferred to another degree programme at Arcada, for which the student meets the requirements for admission.

25 § Reinstatement of the right to study

A student whose right to study has been revoked with the support of 24 §, can apply to Arcada for reinstatement of the right to study. The right to study shall be reinstated if the applicant shows that the reasons for revoking the right to study no longer exist. The student shall submit a statement on his or her state of health to Arcada. The decision on reinstating the right to study is taken by the Board.

26 § Transfer from another university

A student who is studying at another university in Finland may be admitted to Arcada as a transfer student provided that:

the right to study concerns the same degree programme or is comparable therewith, and
the applicant has taken 50 credits/academic year on average and thus demonstrates such academic achievement that graduation is possible within the study time, and
there is an individual study plan that includes all earlier studies in the degree.

The duration of the right to study is counted from the date when the studies started at the first university or university of applied sciences. The application is to be addressed to the rector in accordance with the instructions published on www.arcada.fi External link.

27 § Ethical guidelines and penalties for cheating

Arcada has committed to comply with the guidelines of the Finnish Advisory Board on Research Integrity for conduct of research and procedures for handling violations of them. Arcada has also introduced internal regulations regarding good scientific and research practice.
A student guilty of cheating or otherwise in breach of the guidelines of the Finnish Advisory Board on Research Integrity or Arcada's regulations on good scientific and research practice can be punished with a warning or suspension from Arcada for a limited time of no more than one year in accordance with the provisions stated in Arcada’s regulations. Before the matter is decided, the student shall be given the opportunity to be heard. The rector decides on warnings and the Board on suspension.

28 § Discipline

A student can be given a written warning if he/she

disrupts the teaching,
behaves violently or threateningly,
is guilty of cheating or otherwise in breach of the order at Arcada,
refuses to present a drugs test certificate, according to the Finnish Universities of Applied Sciences Act 36 §, or
according to an investigation, with reference to the Finnish Universities of Applied Sciences Act 36 §, has used drugs for other than medical purposes thus weakening his or her physical and mental ability.

If the action or negligence is serious or if the student continues to behave inappropriately, as intended in clause 1 the student can, after having received a written warning, be suspended from Arcada for a given time, at the most one year.
Decisions on written warnings are made by the rector; decisions on suspension for a given time are made by the Board.

A student has the right to know how the assessment criteria have been applied. The student shall be given the opportunity to acquaint him/herself with the assessed examination. A student who is dissatisfied with the assessment of his/her academic performance according to 9 §, may request for a rectification, orally or in writing, of the examiner who made the assessment. A student who is dissatisfied with the way in which studies completed elsewhere have been accredited or previously attained competencies have been validated according to 10 §, may request for rectification, orally or in writing, of the decision-making person or department. Request for rectification shall be made within 14 days of the date when the student had the opportunity to partake of the assessment and how the assessment criteria have been applied.
