Certified copies of degrees and other certificates
We also provide former students with various documents and certified copies of degree certificates. Order documents via E-mail: studentaffairs@arcada.fi.
Only documents awarded by Arcada can be attested or certified. We cannot attest documents awarded by other institutions. In addition, only copies that are taken by Arcada can be attested or certified. You may therefore bring only your original Degree Certificate. Copies you have taken yourself will not be attested or certified.
Translation of degree certificates
Arcada does not translate degree certificates. Please be in contact with an authorized translator in order for your documents to be translated.
Certificates for alumni's graduated from the educational institutions from which Arcada originates
Arcada University of Applied Sciences was established in 1996 in Helsinki as a merger from the following educational institutions:

the Helsinki Swedish College of Nursing (Helsingfors svenska sjukvårdsinstitut)
the Swedish Commercial College (Svenska handelsläroverket)
the Swedish Institute of Technology (Tekniska Läroverket)
the Folkhälsan Institute of Social Education (Folkhälsans socialläroanstalt)

Please note that copies of Degree Certificates awarded by these institutions are not generated by Arcada UAS anymore. However, certificates regarding the graduation date are issued if the documentation in our archives is sufficient enough (according to the President's Decision 9/2015/P). You cannot receive fee-based documents before making and demonstrating payment of the requested document.
In addition, all documentation regarding Helsinki Swedish College of Nursing (including possible copies of Degree Certificates) are to be found in the National Archives Service of Finland (Kansallisarkisto).
