Support for international students



 










Moving abroad always comes with new experiences and challenges. The International Student Advisor is here to help students who are moving to Finland.

Welcome to Finland
Hi! I'm Laurits Møller, I'm the International Student Advisor at Arcada. I'm here to help you with all of those practical problems that inevitably turn up when you move to a new country.
Am I covered by social security in Finland? How do I get a Kela card? Do I need to exchange my driving licence for a Finnish one? I got a job at a restaurant, how can I get a hygiene passport? What documents do I need to renew my residence permit?
I don't always know the answer to questions like these, but I can help you find the answer! Contact me by email.
Student Discounts
I can give the form for getting you student discount on the HSL Travel Card as well as Kela's meal subsidy card for the subsidised lunch in Arcadas lunch restaurant. For other student benefits I recommend becoming a member of our student union ASK External link and getting a student card through them.
IT support
If you're a new student I can help you activate your Arcada IT User Account. If you're in Helsinki just come see me and bring your passport. If you're not in Finland send me an e-mail and I will send you instructions on how to activate your account. If you have other IT-related questions or problems please contact our IT department.

You'll find me in room C244 in the Library.
