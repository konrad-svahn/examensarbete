Register planned practical training abroad



 









Register your practical training period abroad in advance!

As soon as your practical training agreement/contract is signed, you must register your practical training period in our mobility database MoveON. If you get student financial aid from Kela during your time abroad, it is very important that you register your practical training, However, we need the information in order to be able to report correctly to other authorities as well (e.g. Ministry of Education and Culture, Statistics Finland). Attach your agreement/contract as PDF when registering your practical training period. NOTE! If you do not have an agreement to attach (work certificate if you register the period only afterwards), fill in all other fields and when you are done, contact E-mail: international@arcada.fi and tell us that you have a registration that is complete except for the mandatory attachment. Then we can complete the registration.
