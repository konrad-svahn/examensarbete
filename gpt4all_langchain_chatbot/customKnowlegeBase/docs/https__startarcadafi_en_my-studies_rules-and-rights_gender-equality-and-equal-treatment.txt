Gender equality and equal treatment



 









The activities at Arcada are based on equality and we are striving for ethical and social diversity. Here you can find the plan for gender equality and equal treatment.

We recognise the equal value of all people and wish to promote equal treatment, stand against all manner of discrimination and xenophobia. Equality at Arcada means creating a good learning environment and workplace, where students and staff experience purpose, joy and community in their work and desire to develop the activities and themselves.
An organisation as large as Arcada is by law obligated to produce an equality plan. The plan is based on the Law of Equality between women and men (1986/609) and the Non-Discrimination Act (2014/1325). The plan includes both students and staff at Arcada.
