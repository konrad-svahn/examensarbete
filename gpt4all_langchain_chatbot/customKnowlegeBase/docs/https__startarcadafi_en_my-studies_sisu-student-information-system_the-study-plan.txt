The study plan



 









You need to have a study plan in Sisu in order to enrol for study units. These instructions apply to Arcada's degree students.

When creating your study plan, please take the following into account

You cannot use your phone or tablet to create your study plan, instead, you must use a computer.
You do not need to complete the study plan at once. It is sufficient that you include in the plan those courses for which you wish to register.
You can create several study plans in the Sisu system, but only one can be your primary plan. You can register for courses, submit study-related applications and graduate only according to your primary study plan.
If you have several study plans, remember to check that you are editing the correct plan. The Timeline page automatically opens the most recently edited study plan under the Structure of studies page.

Here are the instructions for activation of your study plan in Sisu.
If you have questions or face a technical issue with Sisu and can't find an answer in the instructions or on the FAQ page, please contact us at E-mail: sisu@arcada.fi The study counsellors can help you with content related questions; do not contact your teachers in questions regarding Sisu.
