Competencies



 








Qualifications after graduation
A Bachelor of Culture and Arts degree gives you the competence and qualification to work within various areas of the media field. The studies give you the competence for e.g. a number of occupations within digital media activities both in practical production and planning, concept development and production management.
Contents of education
Each year of study focuses on a certain theme. The theme of the first year is “The media and I”, and focuses on how you as a student should learn the basics of audio-visual narration with a focus on content-centred production. You also learn to work with environment- and media analysis.
The theme of the second year is “The trade and I”, and teaches you specialisation-specific competences, and you are expected to independently produce and portray documentary reportages, fictive tales, or alternatively online media productions.
The third year has the theme “I and my narrator voice” and “I and my role in society”. You are expected to show an ability to within your specialisation solve conceptual, artistic and formative problems as well as perform artistic assignments within set time frames and display an ability to identify your need of further knowledge, develop a conceptual understanding and broaden your professional competence. You should also show an understanding of the role of art in society and display such readiness and knowledge that is required in order to operate independently in working life.
During the fourth year you are given the opportunity to develop as an expert and developer. The purpose is that you will be able to keep up with the knowledge development within your specialisation. You also through extension studies have the possibility to further focus and broaden your competence in the direction you desire. Through the degree thesis work you can further develop your historical and theoretical understanding of the culture field and the evolution of the culture economy. In this way you develop the ability to create your own initiative, which can be practice-based, research-based, policy-based or a combination of all these.
Career prospects
The education gives you competence for a large number of occupations within digital media operations both in practical production and planning, concept development and production management.
As a Bachelor of Culture and Arts you can work in the media field in Finland or abroad. Many of the employment opportunities are in film- and TV production, a digital agency or the gaming industry. You can work with both documentary and short film production, TV productions or live streaming of different kinds of events. Within the expanding online media sector you can work with design and development of web-based services, mobile applications and interactive media productions.
Work titles
During your studies you prepare for working life by developing a professional portfolio. Depending on your specialisation you might after graduation work as:

Scriptwriter, director, assistant director, concept developer, editor (focus script and directing)
Producer, production assistant, recording director, script supervisor, production coordinator (focus producing)
Photographer, editor, assistant editor, cameraman, camera assistant, recording editor, post-production assistant, lighting director, lighting assistant, broadcast technician
Sound planner, sound technician, theatre technician, AV-technician (focus sound)
Concept developer, graphic designer, program developer, online media editor, web developer, project manager (focus online media)

Continued studies
Should you like to continue your studies after achieving your bachelor’s degree, there are several possibilities. You might choose to carry on at a university with master’s degree studies or, after three years’ work experience, continue studying for a master’s degree at Arcada or another University of Applied Sciences. In the labour market a master’s degree from a UAS corresponds to a master’s degree from a university.
Arcada offers master’s degree studies in e.g. Media Management.
If you after that wish to take yet another step you might after a master’s degree continue with licentiate or doctoral studies at a university.
