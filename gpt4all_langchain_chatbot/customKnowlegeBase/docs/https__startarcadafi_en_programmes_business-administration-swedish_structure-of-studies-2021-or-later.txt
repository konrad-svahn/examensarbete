Structure of studies (2021 or later)



 









The structure of studies for students admitted 2021 or later.

The education is structured so that the student can perform 15 credits (ECTS) during a study period of ten weeks. One credit corresponds to 27 hours of studies or work. Four study periods make up an academic year, and as a student you are expected to complete 60 ECTS per academic year.
The studies consist of general education studies (15 ECTS), professional studies (135 ECTS), development studies (30 ECTS) and research studies (30 ECTS). In total, the education comprises 210 ECTS.
General education studies and foundation studies
During the first year of study the studies consists of so called general education studies and foundation studies. Common for all students of Business Administration (Swedish) are study units from all specialisation areas, Introduction to Business Administration and Business Mathematics and Statistics. Students from Business Administration (Swedish) and International Business take some courses together, which makes the group dynamic and multicultural. These courses are taught in English and contribute to that you after this academic year are comfortable with expressing yourself in English both orally and in writing.
Professional studies
If you have been admitted to Arcada 2019 or after, this structure applies:
Four different specialisation module options are offered during the second year:

Marketing
Logistics
Tourism
Financial Management

Three different support module options are offered during the third year:

Organisational Development
Business Insight Management
Service Development

Subject studies signifies that you choose an area in which you specialise in (Marketing, Logistics, Toursim, Financial Management). This specialisation module comprises 30 ECTS. Further specialisation in the area is achieved through practical training and degree thesis.
A support module á 30 ECTS is also included in the subject studies (Organisational Development, Business Insight Management, Service Development).
The specialisation module completed during the second year (Financial Management, Marketing, Logistics and Tourism) and the support module completed during the third year of study (Organisational Development, Business Insight Management and Service Development) all have 40 vacant student places each. In the end of the first and the second year, all students apply to the desired specialisation or support module for the next academic year. If the applications exceed 40, the selection is made as follows:

the students are selected to the first specialisation module (Financial Management, Marketing, Logistics, Tourism) on the basis of the grade in the introduction course for the specific module (Introduction to Marketing, Introduction to the Tourism Industry, Introduction to Business Logistics or Introduction to Financial Management)
the students are selected to the second support module (Organisational Development, Business Insight Management, Service Development) on the basis of the total mean grade of all courses (20 cr also need to be completed from the specialisation module in order to be eligible to complete this module)

Many of the study units require specific advance knowledge, which means that they must be taken in a predetermined order of succession. The requirements are detailed in the description of the study units. Individual study plans are made to facilitate the course of studies in case of divergence from the set course programme.
If you have been admitted to Arcada before 2019, this structure applies:
Subject studies can signify that you choose an area in which you also specialise, i.e. complete 60 ECTS in. That you also complete your practical training and degree thesis in this area provides further specialisation. Subject studies can also mean that you choose modules of 30 ECTS from two different areas – further specialisation in one of these is achieved through practical training and degree thesis.
Note that all for specialisations are not necessarily offered every year. Depending on the number of students reporting their interest for a module and various other factors, the department has the possibility to consider which specialisation options are offered.

Practical training

Thesis and Research Methods
At the end of the studies you participate in a degree thesis unit where the writing process is supported by methodology, seminars and language support. The degree thesis is often connected to a company as a commissioned work. The choice of subject for the degree thesis in combination with the chosen focus area and practical training defines your specialisation.
The degree thesis is written towards the end of the studies. The work is commenced by participating in a seminar course that runs during the third year of study. In the seminar course the student among other things makes up a plan for their degree thesis. Most degree theses are written in collaboration with external clients.
