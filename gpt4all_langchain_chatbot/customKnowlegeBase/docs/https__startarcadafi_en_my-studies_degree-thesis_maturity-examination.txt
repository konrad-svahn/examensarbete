Maturity examination



 








The aim of the maturity test is to show mastery of your research topic as well as your linguistic maturity. In the maturity test, you show your ability to write an investigative essay, on a subject which is connected with your Bachelors’ or Masters’ thesis. You write the maturity test after the thesis has been passed and presented.
The language of the maturity test
The language in which the maturity test should be written in is based on your school language if you have received your education in Finnish or Swedish. However, students who received their education in another language than Finnish or Swedish, or received their education overseas, take the maturity examination in the degree language. If the maturity test is taken in a language other than Finnish or Swedish, the maturity test is reviewed solely on the basis of the content.
The content is evaluated by the supervisor and the use of language by a competent language teacher.
