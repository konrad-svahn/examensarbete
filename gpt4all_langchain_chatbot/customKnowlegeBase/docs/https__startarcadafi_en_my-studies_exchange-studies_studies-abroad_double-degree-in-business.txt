Double Degree in Business



 








What is a Double Degree?
An international double degree is a form of cooperation between two higher education institutions. Both institutions have their own curricula and students complete an agreed amount of their degree abroad at the partner institution and obtain a degree from both institutions. The double degree should be completed within the timeframe of one’s study right.
The agreement is made with partner institutions that can offer a deeper understanding of some of the competences required when graduating from Arcada. The content of the studies are carefully compared and agreed on. This is to make sure that the studies completed during the exchange bring qualitative added value to both of the degrees obtained.

Arcada has three Double degree agreements in business.
One with Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences in Germany,
