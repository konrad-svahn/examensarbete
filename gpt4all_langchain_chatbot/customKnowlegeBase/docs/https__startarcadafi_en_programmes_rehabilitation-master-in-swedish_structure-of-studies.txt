Structure of studies



 








The studies comprise 90 credits (ects) and are conducted over a period of 2-3 years part-time. The studies consist of both distance- and contact studies with on average two days of tuition per month and they can be carried out parallel to gainful employment. The tuition is partially web-based and consists of e.g. lectures, workshops and seminars.
If required, a personal study plan is made to facilitate the studies. With the aid of a personal study plan, the studies can be structured to form a meaningful whole that supports the individual competence development process.
In the degree programme an active, self-directed learning where the student takes responsibility for their own learning is advocated. The learning processes and forms of examination promote the development of the studentâ€™s ability for a critical approach, problem solving, deep learning and understanding as well as the development of a professional mode of operating in practice. A scientific approach is a natural part in the learning process. The knowledge- and competence development takes place in dialogue between students, instructors and the working life. The purpose of the learning is that the student gains the readiness to direct and participate in change- and development activities in practical functions.
