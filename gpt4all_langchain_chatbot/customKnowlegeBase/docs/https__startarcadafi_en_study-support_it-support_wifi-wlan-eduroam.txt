WiFi (WLAN, Eduroam)



 








Eduroam
Students and staff use the wireless network called eduroam. It is part of a global network provided by universities and alike. It works in most Finnish universities and also internationally. It also has mobile app that shows you the nearest Eduroam hotspot so that you can be automatically connected to the internet once you are in that hotspot's range.
Arcada-guest
Arcada-guest is used by visitors. It has a very limited bandwidth and students and staff should not need to use it. The password changes daily and is published on the information screen at the big square, on ARBS under Rapport - Guest WiFi and on every room-booking.
