Tuition fees



 










Information about fees for tuition fee-paying students.

According to the Universities of Applied Sciences Act 932/2014 13 a § (Amendment 1601/2015) all Universities of Applied Sciences in Finland must charge a tuition fee for Bachelor’s and Master’s degree programmes taught in a language other than Finnish or Swedish.
Who is required to pay?
The fee applies to students from countries outside the European Union/EEA-area. There are however exemptions that can free a non-EU/EEA citizen from paying the fee. The fee will not be charged from students who are equated with EU area citizens. The exemption will also apply to those who have an EU blue card stated in the Aliens Act, a permanent residence permit, or a continuous residence permit granted on other grounds than studies.A student who is exempt from paying the tuition fee because of their residence status shall submit a copy of their new residence permit when the previous one has expired. Arcada monitors this actively. Students who fail to submit a renewed proof of exemption must pay the tuition fee.
If you are unsure as to whether you are required to pay or not, please see this guide on Studyinfo External link. Please also note, that tuition fees are not charged if your right to study started before 1 August 2017. If you reapply to Arcada and receive a new right to study, you may be liable to pay.
Change to residence or citizenship status
Changes to residence or citizenship status during studies will be considered as follows:

If the change of status means that you are no longer liable to pay tuition fees, any fees covering the time after the change will be reimbursed as of the following term. However, changes reported during the first academic year do not entitle to a refund of the tuition fee for the academic year in question but shall be noted as of the start of the second academic year. You shall immediately inform Arcada of any changes that may affect your liability to pay tuition fees.
If your status changes so that you become liable to pay tuition fees, the liability will begin as of the following term. You shall immediately inform Arcada of any changes that may affect your liability to pay tuition fees.
If you have received a scholarship and your status changes so that you are no longer liable to pay, you are no longer eligible for the scholarship.

Changes to the liability to pay tuition fees will come into effect as of the beginning of the term following the change of status. One academic year consists of an autumn term (1 August to 31 December) and a spring term (1 January to 31 July).
If you expect that your residence permit status is about to change and if you are not sure how this would affect your liability to pay the tuition fees, please contact Student Affairs.

Early bird offer for students admitted in 2024
Applicants who accept their study place and pay the fee within two weeks after receiving notification of a study place offer, receive an early bird discount of 3,000 euros for the first academic year. The discount applies to both bachelor's and master's students.
How do I pay?
The payment is made by bank transfer in advance. Please find more information on payment here.
When is the deadline?
The last payment date is 15 August each academic year. However, please note that you need to apply for extended residence permit before your previous permit expires. Please find more information here.
Refund handling fee
Please note that students, in case of applying for a tuition fee refund, will be charged 250€ to cover the refund administrative costs. Students who apply for refund because their status has changed so that they are no longer liable to pay tuition fees, do not have to pay the refund handling fee.
First year's tuition fee can only be refunded in accordance with the Terms and Conditions distributed in the admission process. All other years' tuition fees can be refunded per semester if you have not completed any studies during that academic semester. You have to apply for the semester's refund during or before the semester that you wish to be refunded for. If you are applying for a refund for an on-going spring term you have to send in your application for a refund at the latest on 15 May, as no refund applications are processed during the summer months June-August.
Examples:

you cannot in January apply for a refund for the previous autumn term
you cannot in July apply for a refund for the ongoing spring term, and also
you cannot in August apply for a refund for the previous academic year (an academic year is always 1 August - 31 July).

If you receive a refund, you will be registered as absent (note exceptions regarding first year of studies), unless the refund is granted because your status has changed to non-paying. You may also decide to terminate your studies. 
Does Arcada offer scholarships?
We offer scholarships for Bachelor's level studies. The scholarships are awarded on the basis of academic performance. Please read more about the scholarships here.
Arcada UAS reserves all rights to make changes to the payment process and the payment deadlines of the tuition fee.
