Zoom for video communication



 









At Arcada we are using Zoom and Teams for online meetings. You find Zoom at arcada.zoom.us. You can also download the application from https://zoom.us/download to your computer and mobile phone. With these, you can both start and attend a Zoom meeting. 

Before you attend a Zoom meeting you need to check that your sound (microphone and speaker) and image (webcam) are working. Before entering a meeting you have an opportunity to make a sound test. You can also go to Zoom test page and check everything in advance.
