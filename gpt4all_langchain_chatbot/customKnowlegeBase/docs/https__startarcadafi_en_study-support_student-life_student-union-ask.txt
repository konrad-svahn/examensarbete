Arcada Student Union



 










The student union is the students’ own organization that exists to monitor students' interests and promote cooperation between students and the university. The student union at Arcada is called Arcada Student Union - ASK and is the common denominator of all students at Arcada, regardless of field of study.

ASK was founded in 1997, then as a registered association, ASKen r.f. Since August 2005 the student unions in the Universities of Applied Sciences have had an official position and a legislated duty to promote student’s interests. The student union conducts its activities for the benefit of its members, not for financial gain.
ASK monitors students' interests at various levels, both regionally and nationally. The two biggest tasks that the student union has are to represent students in Arcada's various decision-making bodies, and to make Arcada students' voices heard on a national level.
ASK is located in the Cor-house External link, which is the students’ own house. On the second floor you can find ASK’s office, here you can find our Board and staff if you feel like dropping by and say hello.
Visit www.asken.fi External link for more information about the student union. You can also find ASK on Facebook External link and Instagram External link.
