Right to be absent



 









How long can I be absent?

If you have been admitted to Arcada before 2015, these rules apply:
You have the right to be absent for a total of two academic years (eight periods) during the course of study. Registered leaves of absence are not included in the calculated period of study. You do not have to give a reason for your absence. Military service or maternity leave do not entitle to extra absence in addition to these two academic years.
If you have have been admitted to Arcada in 2015 or later, these rules apply:
You have the right to be absent for a total of one academic year (four periods). Registered leaves of absence are not included in the calculated period of study. You do not have to give a reason for your absence.
In addition, you are entitled to extra absence for these reasons:

military service, non-military service or women's voluntary military service
maternity, paternity, or parental leave

If you want to register as absent for any of above reasons, you shall submit a certificate supporting your claim to Student Services, in order not to consume the year you can be absent without special reason.
More information about registering as absent during the first academic year is found here External link.
What are the consequences of registering as absent?
If you register as absent, you do not have the right to pursue studies at Arcada. You may not take exams or go on student exchange. You are not entitled to thesis supervision. You are not entitled to student financial aid and other benefits, such as cheaper lunch or discounted public transport.
Please note that the right to register as absent should be used sparingly because courses are planned for a whole academic year. If you need to be absent, you should discuss the issue with your study counsellor, because there might be implications for your study plan.
What kind of certificates should I submit?
Please submit proof if you are absent on these grounds:

military service, non-military service or women's voluntary military service
maternity, paternity, or parental leave
