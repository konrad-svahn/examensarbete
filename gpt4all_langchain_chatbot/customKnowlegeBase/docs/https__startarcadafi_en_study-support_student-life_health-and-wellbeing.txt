Starting 1 January 2021, the Finnish Student Health Service (FSHS) will provide student healthcare services for all higher education students. Read more here.
Before the first practical training students enrolled in Social and Health care are required to check their vaccinations and get the Tuberculous risk assessment done by the FSHS External link. Here you can read more about it.
Arcada offers students many opportunities for personal support. As a full-time student at Arcada you have access to school nurses (until 15.12.2020). Here you can find more information about health care at Arcada. External link
In addition to the Health Care Services there is also a Study Counsellor / Special Education Teacher to help you with your studies. You also have the opportunity to meet with the student chaplain. Note that only registered full-time students are eligible to use health care services. Open YH students should turn to their own local Health Center (or alternatively occupational health care).
