Structure of studies



 









The studies in occupational therapy are tied to year-based study plans and many of the courses require specific advance knowledge. This means that courses should be taken in a specific order and progression as advancement within the knowledge area of occupational therapy then will prove possible . When there is need for the individual student to depart from the set course programme, individual study plans are made to facilitate the course of studies. Through an individually planned extended vocational practice period, choice of subject for the degree thesis and extension studies the student can choose a specific focus within their field.
