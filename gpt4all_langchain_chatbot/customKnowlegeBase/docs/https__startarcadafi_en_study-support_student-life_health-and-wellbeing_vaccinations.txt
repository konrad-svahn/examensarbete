Vaccinations



 








Vaccination certificates
It is recommended to have all general vaccinations in order and that all available certificates of vaccination are brought to Finland. All students admitted should have the following vaccinations in order when studies commence; tetanus/diphtheria, polio and MMR- vaccine (measles, mumps, rubella). Everyone should also get two doses of chickenpox vaccine if they have never had chickenpox or were never vaccinated. 
A student at the degree programme in Nursing will not be permitted to begin practical training if vaccinations are not in order and the nurses check risk of tuberculosis. 
Degree students may contact FSHV External link for vaccines. If you are not a degree student, please contact your own health station.
