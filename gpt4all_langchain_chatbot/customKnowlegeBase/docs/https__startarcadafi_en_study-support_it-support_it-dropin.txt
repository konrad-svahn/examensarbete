IT Dropin



 








We have our IT Dropin service available Mon-Fri at office hours for our students and staffs. You can come to the Dropin point which is located in the journal reading room beside the library. There is usually a digital banner running to indicate its location. There is also a landphone on the table which you can use to directly contact us. Then we will come over there and meet you in person. Dropins are a great way to get more personal help regarding complex issues. 
Some common Dropin topics are:

You have problems installing Office365 on your computer
You have problems formatting in Word
You cannot get Arcada email to work on your phone
You have licensing problems with the Office365 package
Wifi connection issue

But in general, you can come to the Dropins regarding any IT issues.
