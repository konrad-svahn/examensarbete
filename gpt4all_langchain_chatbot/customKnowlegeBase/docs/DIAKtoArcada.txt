Transferring study attainments from DIAK to Arcada

Fill out the form below (Form 6b) to transfer credits for courses you have taken at Diak as part of the Arcada-Diak degree programme in Nursing. If you have other studies from Diak you would like to transfer, you should use the ordinary application for accreditation (more info here).

Before you fill out the form log in to the My Studyinfo External link

-site to create a shared link for your Diak study attainments. You can then put the link in the form.

For instructions on how to use My Studyinfo see below.

Until November 15th 2022 the PURO service was used to transfer credits, but PURO is no longer in use. Study attainments that have been transferred using PURO before November 15 have been registered already in ASTA. If you are missing courses in ASTA that you have tranferred using PURO please contact Student Affairs.
