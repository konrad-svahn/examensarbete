Alumni Network



 








With thousands of Arcada alumni spread all over the world, getting involved with our alumni activities offers you access to a valuable network of skilled professionals.
Participate in alumni events, keep in touch with old friends, make new acquaintances and stay up to date with all the recent developments at Arcada. It also makes it easy to keep an eye on all the opportunities we offer you to further your education.
The Arcada alumni network is a professional and social network for all those who have graduated from Arcada University of Applied Science, or the former Arcada precursors, i.e. Svenska sjukvårdsinstitutet (Sjukis), Svenska Handelsläroverket (Lilla Hanken), Tekniska Läroverket (Verket), och Folkhälsans socialläroanstalt. Former exchange students at Arcada Univerisity of Applied Sciences are also welcomed as Arcada alumni.
