*The demanded 60 credits can consist of studies completed at Arcada but also of courses completed at other universities/universities of applied sciences* (added to your transcript of credits through credit transfer), either prior to you commencing your studies at Arcada or during your studies at Arcada. Please note that the transferred credits have to fit in to your curriculum and be included in your final degree (example: courses have to align with your degree programme's competencies); please contact your study counselor before applying for transferring, and also before you sign up for courses at other universities/universities of applied sciences. Arcada and its' degree programme directors have the right to deny an application for credit transfer if the courses do not fit in to your curriculum or if the total amount of credits will ultimately exceed the total amount of credits demanded for graduation. Studies completed during exchange studies are credit transfers; note that studies completed during exchange studies are transferred with the following grades: Pass or Fail. The mean grade on your transcript of credits is not affected by courses graded Pass.
Scholarships if you were admitted in 2024
Scholarships are only awarded to bachelor students who have studied at least one academic year at Arcada. Students who have completed an average of 55 ECTS per academic year with a grade point average of 4.5 during their studies at Arcada can, upon request, be granted a scholarship corresponding to 40 percent of the tuition fee for the upcoming academic year.
The changes come into force on 1 January 2024 and affect students who start their studies in 2024 or later. Students who have started their studies in 2023 or earlier are not affected by these changes.
Exchange studies and scholarship
This applies only if you are on international student exchange during the Spring semester, and the credits from the other school abroad cannot be processed by Arcada UAS by 31 July.
These students are to pay the full tuition fee for the Autumn semester in accordance with the tuition fee payment's deadlines, and will be registered as present for only the Autumn semester. Scholarship: Immediately, once it has been proven by the school abroad (official transcript of records) that you have attained at least 60 credits during that academic year (1 August - 31 July) then you are to contact Student Affairs and pay the missing part of the tuition fee (with or without a scholarship's reduction) to register as present for the Spring semester. You will also need to fill in the application for a scholarship by 31 October, if you are eligible for one, as Arcada UAS need to be able to present all approved scholarships to the tax authorities.
If it during the Autumn semester becomes clear you have not attained 60 credits during the previous academic year then you are to pay the full tuition fee for the Spring semester in accordance with the tuition fee payment's deadline.
Scholarship application for academic year 2023-2024
Please note that the above-mentioned process regarding exchange studies and scholarship also, exceptionally, applies during the application for a scholarship during the summer of 2023 for all students, if needed. This means: if you have not attained 60 credits registered on your Arcada UAS transcript of records by 16 June 2023, you can pay the full tuition fee for the autumn semester 2023 and only register as present for the autumn semester. Then, once you can prove that you in deed did attain 60 credits during 1 Aug 2022 - 31 July 2023 you can apply for a scholarship that will cover partly or fully the spring semester's tuition fee (30 % or 50 % scholarship). Your application for the scholarship regarding spring 2024 has to be sent in before 31 October 2023.
This is an exceptional procedure during the summer of 2023 as Arcadas UAS will change its student information system.
