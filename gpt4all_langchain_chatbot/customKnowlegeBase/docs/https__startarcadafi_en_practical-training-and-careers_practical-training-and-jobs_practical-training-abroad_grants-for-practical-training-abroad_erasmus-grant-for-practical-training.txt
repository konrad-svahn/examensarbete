As green mobility grant, the student receives 50 € top-up to their grant. In addition, max 4 travels days can be added to the duration of the mobility.
Special Needs and Inclusion support - Erasmus+
You can apply for exchange even if you have special needs. You should contact the international coordinator at Arcada (E-mail: international@arcada.fi) in good time before the application deadline so that we can start the arrangements as early as possible. To ensure that students with special needs can take full advantage of the Erasmus or Nordplus exchange, both programs offers extra funding for students with special needs. You may be entitled to extra funding if you have a disability, illness or other exceptional special needs that will cause extra costs during your exchange and which are not covered by other sources. You can find more information about the support for students with special needs on The Finnish National Board of Education's website External link.
Rolling application process- step by step
There is a rolling application process with no specific deadlines. Please submit required documents at the latest, two weeks before the start of your practical training, to ensure that we get everything ready before deadline (the start of your internship). If possible, an application submitted later than that is also processed, but it cannot be guaranteed as we need to have everything ready before the start.
The selection is based on a first come first served basis. Most likely there will be funding available for all interested in going on Erasmus funded practical training abroad.
