Applying for Certificates for Student Benefits



 










Read these instructions before applying for certificates for students benefits (HSL public transport, VR trains, Matkahuolto buses and student lunch)

Student card – all student benefits in one place
Please remember that you do not need any discount certificates if you have a student card. Through becoming an ASK student union member you will also have access to several student discounts (museums, restaurants, cafés, stores etc.). Apply for your student card from the student union by visiting their homepage. External link Please note that Matkahuolto's long distance buses and VR's long distance trains only offer student discounts to students with a valid student card.
VR has listed all approved student cards on this site External link (scroll down and click Accepted student cards to see the full list). VR's list contains a wide variety of national student card providers with different services and fees.
Student lunch and KELA meal subsidy card
Students receive the right to eat a state subsidised lunch by presenting a valid student card or a stamped KELA meal stubsidy card. You can order your KELA meal subsidy card by sending an e-mail to E-mail: studentaffairs@arcada.fi or visiting us in the library during our opening hours.
HSL public transport in Helsinki metropolitan area
In the HSL app you can buy discounted season tickets. You will need to log in using Finnish banking codes to confirm your student status. Foreign students may need to inform Arcada about their Finnish personal identify number (social security number) for the app to work. You can submit your Finnish personal identify number here if you haven't already done so.
If you do not yet have Finnish banking codes you can fill out an HSL form and have Arcada Student Services sign it. Take the signed form to an HSL office to enable the student discount on your plastic travel card.
Read more about the student discount on HSL's website External link.
