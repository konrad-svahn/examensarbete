Evaluation criteria for the final thesis project



 










Your thesis is evaluated and graded based on set criteria. These criteria have been developed by the assessors and teaching staff at Arcada, taking into account the European Qualifications Framework for education.

The evaluation of the thesis is done by the assessor along with the supervisor. The assessor writes a statement that is a complete examination of the thesis. The statement is also signed by the supervisor. The supervisor has the right to request a thesis language revision.
With regard to practice in the subject and nature of the work, the degree thesis and master thesis are evaluated as excellent (5), very good (4), good (3), satisfactory (2) or sufficient (1). The grade is justified in the statement and determined by an overall assessment on the basis of the work, the maturity exam and presentation.
Theses at Arcada UAS need to correspond to the requirements set by the European Qualifications Framework External link (EQF); level 6 for bachelor's level and level 7 for master's. At the end of this website you can find links to PDF files with evaluation criteria for both bachelor's and master's theses as tables.
