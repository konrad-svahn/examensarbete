Oral health care for students



 








Degree students have access to dental care via the Finnish Student Healtcare Service External link starting from 1 January 2021.
If you are not a degree student:
Students ofÂ  universities of applied sciences are admitted for treatment based on urgency and the need for treatment. In case you are studying in Helsinki but are resident of another city (for instance Espoo, Vantaa) you can choose which service you would like to use.
Appointments at the dental clinic in Helsinki can be booked by calling 09 310 51400 (Mon-Thu 7-18, Fri 7-15), where the urgency of treatment is assessed.
Dental examinations and dental care to customers aged 18 and above is charged according to the statute on customer fees.
