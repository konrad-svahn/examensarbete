User Account and Password



 










In order to participate in the introduction day, you need to have activated your Arcada user account.

Activation of the user account
For using Arcada’s IT Services and Education tools, you will get your own personal IT User Account. When you accept your study place in Arcada, a User Account is automatically created for you in our system. All you need to do then is to activate it and set up a password.
Go to Arcada Account Services (AAS) External link to activate you User Account. You can use a Netbanking authentication service of any Finnish bank, a Finnish electronic ID, a mobile certificate, or an active user account at some other Finnish university through Haka login to log into AAS.
If you cannot use any of the above methods you will need a Password reset token to activate your IT User Account. Please contact the International Student Advisor to get your token.

Important information about your IT-account
As an Arcada student, you will have a user account consisting of a username (login) and a password.
You are personally responsible for the user account and password. By using Arcada's IT-services you confirm that you have read and agreed to the IT rules and policies. In case the user should break the law or Arcada's IT rules, the IT unit has the right to immediately lock the user account for a maximum period of two months.
Your account will be valid throughout your entire study time at Arcada. The account will be disabled 1 week after the study right has terminated.
Your Arcada user account and password should not be used to sign up to other web pages or IT services outside Arcada.
Please note that you may under no circumstances hand out your user name or password to anyone, not even IT-personnel or administrators. IT does not require or ever will ask your Password to fix anything in your Account.
Verifying your identity during a support session
When you are served by our IT support, you need to verify your identity by presenting your passport. After that, IT Support gives you a token code that you use on the Arcada Account Services page: https://apps.arcada.fi/aas External link
Some important things to note:

We can not give you an account without verifying you correctly with your passport.
If you are attending a support session online, do so via a computer. Do not use a telephone or mobile device.
For online support session(s), test your webcam and microphone's functionality in advance. You will also need a good internet connection. Due to time constraints, it is important that you prepare according to these instructions and that all technology works well.

If you are unable to use any of the options above, please contact E-mail: it-support@arcada.fi.
