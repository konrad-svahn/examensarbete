How to share your transcript of records through My Studyinfo



 









Instructions for My Studyinfo

If you’ve studied at a university or university of applied sciences in Finland but you don’t have a transcript of records of your studies, you can check if your studies are visible on the national “My Studyinfo” site and then share the data from there. To be able to log in to My Studyinfo you need to have a Finnish bank log-in and for foreign students Arcada needs to have your Finnish personal identify number (social security number). You can submit your Finnish personal identify number here if you haven't already done so.
Follow these steps:
Go to My Studyinfo: https://studyinfo.fi/oma-opintopolku/ External link
Click on “Proceed to studies”.

 







Identify yourself using your online bank credentials.
Once you have successfully logged in, click on the Share study information button.

 







Select which studies you want to share and click on Share the studies you've selected. If e.g. you've taken a CampusOnline.fi course that was organised by Metropolia select "Metropolia ammattikorkeakoulu".

 







You have now created a link that you can give to anyone who you want to see your study attainments. Copy the link by clicking the Copy link button.
Test the link by opening a new window in your browser and pasting the link into the address bar. This will show you what others see when you give them the link.
That’s it, your done! Now you can paste the link into your application for accreditation of studies from another university, or send it to your employer to prove what courses you have taken or just share it with your friends.

 







If you want to check what the recipient sees when they use your link you can click ① "See what the transcript of records looks like in browser". The link expires on the date shown on the right ④, after that the information can no longer be accessed through the link.
If you want to create another link click on ② "Create new". In case you made a wrong link, you can delete it by choosing ③ "Delete link". Please note, that when you delete a link the people you shared it with can no longer see your studies.
