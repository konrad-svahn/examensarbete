Instructions for registering for the academic year



 










Students are, by law, required to register for each academic year. Students who fail to renew their registration in time lose the right to study.

At Arcada, registration for the academic year shall be made every year during the time 15 April – 10 September.

Registration happens through the national OILI-system. Students who were admitted before 1st of August 2015 and do not have a Finnish social number in ASTA cannot register via OILI. Instead those students are required to contact student services at C3 and renew their registration with a paper form.
Register for the academic year at arcada.fi/registration External link.
