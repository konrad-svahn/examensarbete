Professional competencies (study plans 2021 onwards)



 










Arcada's study plans (curricula) consist of modules that define the competencies that you need to attain in order to graduate. You can read about the professional competencies that you will develop here. 

Competence in Natural Science
(According to the recommendations of SEFI & EUR-ACE)
Knowledge
You can analyze and solve advanced problems using your knowledge in mathematics, physics
and chemistry. You know basic programming.
Skills
Regardless of the profile the engineers can apply mathematics when planning and dimensioning technical devices. Knowledge in mathematics is a prerequisite to follow development and research in your own field. You can independently use mathematics and programming languages in communicating and solving problems with colleagues in the field.
Attitude
You understand the difference between a mathematical / scientific model of a physical phenomenon and the phenomenon itself. You value the great work researchers have done that now forms the foundation of the knowledge in mathematics and natural sciences that we have today. You understand the importance of a strong mathematical and physical background to facilitate the understanding of your later professional studies. You are aware that programming and machine learning are two strong tools that can help you to solve problems that are impossible to solve manually.
Competence in Sustainability
Knowledge
You have research-based knowledge of three global challenges: climate change, declining biodiversity and overconsumption of natural resources. You understand the climate forcings caused by anthropogenic consumption of energy and materials, and what are sustainable methods for energy production and storage and raw material extraction, processing and recycling. You understand that our current consumption of goods and services is unsustainable in the long run and that we need to get off our dependence of fossil fuels and raw material within a relatively short period of time. You understand the principles of the circular economy and you know quantitative analytical methods such as life cycle analysis. You have knowledge of environmental management systems.
Skills
You use your knowledge of materials and energy to make environmental-friendly designs, methods and choices. You work to minimize the use of materials and energy in existing technical systems and can consider their transformational changes towards circularity and carbon neutrality. You use analysis methods such us life cycle analysis for evidence-based decision-making on technical-economic solutions.
Attitude
You are driven to make meaningful work for a climate-smart and sustainable society that leads to a better living environment for all beings. You are aware of the complexity of environmental feedbacks and how they couple with industrial impacts.You understand the importance of quantifying the complete flows of energy and materials and strive to find viable circular solutions that are sustainable.
Competence in Modeling
Knowledge
You are familiar with the digital methods and tools that are used for measurements, analysis, technical drawing, and 3D-modeling.
Skills
You can use digital methods and tools such as measurement techniques and analysis, technical drawing, and 3D-modeling for evidence-based decision-making on technical solutions.
Attitude
You can take advantages of the possibilities that digital methods and 3D-modeling offer to support development of the sustainable life and carbon neutral society.
Competence in Materials Technology
Knowledge
You have knowledge of basic materials science and manufacturing methods. You have the knowledge on sustainable materials, and you follow the development on the state-of-the-art in the Nordic region and worldwide. You will learn mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties of materials. You develop the ability to conduct scientific research related to sustainable materials and processes based on the latest developments. You are aware that materials and manufacturing methods can pose a risk to life and health and you know the safe working methods.
Skills
You can perform material-technical calculations that are based on theories. Based on the knowledge on material properties, you will have the skills to select engineering materials in conventional design processes. As part of sustainable process development, you develop the skills on selecting sustainable engineering materials. You will have the skills on a variety of digital and conventional materials processing technologies to apply them for sustainable product development. You can take necessary precautions to avoid dangerous situation during manufacturing and production.
Attitude
You work for a climate-smart and safe society. You develop actively yourself for better material selections and work safety. You have a well-grounded point of view related to a well though end of life disposal solutions for products produced with traditional methods in order reduce their carbon footprint. You follow the growing lists of sustainable materials developments around the Nordic region and support the development process through research alongside partner institutes, companies and so forth.
Competence in Design
Knowledge
You have the knowledge of mathematics and physics that are the foundations of engineering design. You will have deep theoretical knowledge on analytical approaches used in product and process designs. You will develop the ability to apply design optimization methods in product/process design processes.You understand the role of digital design and manufacturing in developing smart and sustainable solutions in modern day engineering.
Skills
You will have skills on geometrical modelling of engineering components, products, and mechanical systems on different computer aided design (CAD) software. You will develop skills on geometrically modelling and solving engineering problems related to structural, thermal and fluid flow on computation software to verify analytical methods. You will have skills on conducting a variety of experimental investigations for material testing. You will develop practical skills on both conventional
processing technologies and the state-of-the art in additive manufacturing.
Attitude
You can apply the ethical codes and safety procedures implicated within the working life. You develop a strong attitude towards design for environment making sure the traditional designs processes are reviewed and replaced by sustainable product /process design approaches. You value the recent approaches towards digital transformations in manufacturing systems and contribute professionally to the cause. You put human safety and environment first when you develop new designs and technologies.
