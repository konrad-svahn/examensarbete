So all in all it was a great trip with many new experiences, new friends and sometimes an emotional rollercoaster between wanting to go home, wanting to stay and just not knowing what you want to do. To be honest if I had the chance I would have stayed another year but I am sure I will be back soon.- Jenny, Vancouver
